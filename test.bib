abstract = {Massive protostars have associated bipolar outflows that can produce strong shocks when they interact with the surrounding medium. At these shocks particles can be accelerated up to relativistic energies. Relativistic electrons and protons can then produce gamma-ray emission, as some theoretical models predict. To identify young galactic objects that may emit gamma rays, we crossed the Fermi First Year Catalog with some catalogs of known massive young stellar objects (MYSOs), early type stars, and OB associations, and we implemented Monte Carlo simulations to find the probability of chance coincidences. We obtained a list of massive MYSOs that are spatially coincident with Fermi sources. Our results indicate that \sim 70% of these candidates should be gamma-ray sources with a confidence of \sim 5{\sigma}. We studied the coincidences one by one to check the viability of these young sources as potential counterparts to Fermi sources and made a short list of best targets for new detailed multifrequency observations. The results for other type of young galactic objects are not conclusive.

abstract = {The middle-aged supernova remnant (SNR) W44 has recently attracted attention because of its relevance regarding the origin of Galactic cosmic-rays. The gamma-ray missions AGILE and Fermi have established, for the first time for a SNR, the spectral continuum below 200 MeV which can be attributed to neutral pion emission. Confirming the hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission near 100 MeV is then of the greatest importance. Our paper is focused on a global re-assessment of all available data and models of particle acceleration in W44, with the goal of determining on a firm ground the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the overall spectrum. We also present new gamma-ray and CO NANTEN2 data on W44, and compare them with recently published AGILE and Fermi data. Our analysis strengthens previous studies and observations of the W44 complex environment and provides new information for a more detailed modeling. In particular, we determine that the average gas density of the regions emitting 100 MeV - 10 GeV gamma-rays is relatively high (n= 250 - 300 cm^-3). The hadronic interpretation of the gamma-ray spectrum of W44 is viable, and supported by strong evidence. It implies a relatively large value for the average magnetic field (B > 10^2 microG) in the SNR surroundings, sign of field amplification by shock-driven turbulence. Our new analysis establishes that the spectral index of the proton energy distribution function is p1 = 2.2 +/- 0.1 at low energies and p2 = 3.2 +/- 0.1 at high energies. We critically discuss hadronic versus leptonic-only models of emission taking into account simultaneously radio and gamma-ray data. We find that the leptonic models are disfavored by the combination of radio and gamma-ray data. Having determined the hadronic nature of the gamma-ray emission on firm ground, a number of theoretical challenges remains to be addressed.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore the evolution of a PWN while the pulsar is spinning down. An MHD approach is used to simulate the evolution of a composite remnant. Particular attention is given to the adiabatic loss rate and evolution of the nebular field strength with time. By normalising a two component particle injection spectrum (which can reproduce the radio and X-ray components) at the pulsar wind termination shock to the time dependent spindown power, and keeping track with losses since pulsar/PWN/SNR birth, we show that the average field strength decreases with time as $t^{-1.3}$, so that the synchrotron flux decreases, whereas the IC gamma-ray flux increases, until most of the spindown power has been dumped into the PWN. Eventually adiabatic and IC losses will also terminate the TeV visibility and then eventually the GeV visibility.},

abstract = {Aims: The supernova remnant (SNR) complex CTB 37 is an interesting candidate for observations with very high energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray telescopes such as HESS. In this region, three SNRs are seen. One of them is potentially associated with several molecular clouds, a circumstance that can be used to probe the acceleration of hadronic cosmic rays. Methods: This region was observed with the HESS Cherenkov telescopes and the data were analyzed with standard HESS procedures. Recent X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton were used to search for X-ray counterparts. Results: The discovery of a new VHE $\gamma$-ray source HESS J1714-385 coincident with the remnant CTB 37A is reported. The energy spectrum is well described by a power-law with a photon index of $\Gamma$ = 2.30 $\pm$ 0.13 and a differential flux at 1 TeV of $\Phi$0 = (8.7 $\pm$ 1.0stat $\pm$ 1.8sys) × 10-13 cm-2 s-1 TeV-1. The integrated flux above 1 TeV is equivalent to 3% of the flux of the Crab nebula above the same energy. This VHE $\gamma$-ray source is a counterpart candidate for the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1714-3857. The observed VHE emission is consistent with the molecular gas distribution around CTB 37A; a close match is expected in a hadronic scenario for $\gamma$-ray production. The X-ray observations reveal the presence of thermal X-rays from the NE part of the SNR. In the NW part of the remnant, an extended non-thermal X-ray source, CXOU J171419.8-383023, is discovered as well. Possible connections of the X-ray emission to the newly found VHE source are discussed.},

abstract = {The Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT, hereafter LAT), the primary instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) mission, is an imaging, wide field-of-view (FoV), high-energy $\gamma$-ray telescope, covering the energy range from below 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. The LAT was built by an international collaboration with contributions from space agencies, high-energy particle physics institutes, and universities in France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. This paper describes the LAT, its preflight expected performance, and summarizes the key science objectives that will be addressed. On-orbit performance will be presented in detail in a subsequent paper. The LAT is a pair-conversion telescope with a precision tracker and calorimeter, each consisting of a 4 × 4 array of 16 modules, a segmented anticoincidence detector that covers the tracker array, and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system. Each tracker module has a vertical stack of 18 (x, y) tracking planes, including two layers (x and y) of single-sided silicon strip detectors and high-Z converter material (tungsten) per tray. Every calorimeter module has 96 CsI(Tl) crystals, arranged in an eight-layer hodoscopic configuration with a total depth of 8.6 radiation lengths, giving both longitudinal and transverse information about the energy deposition pattern. The calorimeter's depth and segmentation enable the high-energy reach of the LAT and contribute significantly to background rejection. The aspect ratio of the tracker (height/width) is 0.4, allowing a large FoV (2.4 sr) and ensuring that most pair-conversion showers initiated in the tracker will pass into the calorimeter for energy measurement. Data obtained with the LAT are intended to (1) permit rapid notification of high-energy $\gamma$-ray bursts and transients and facilitate monitoring of variable sources, (2) yield an extensive catalog of several thousand high-energy sources obtained from an all-sky survey, (3) measure spectra from 20 MeV to more than 50 GeV for several hundred sources, (4) localize point sources to 0.3-2 arcmin, (5) map and obtain spectra of extended sources such as SNRs, molecular clouds, and nearby galaxies, (6) measure the diffuse isotropic $\gamma$-ray background up to TeV energies, and (7) explore the discovery space for dark matter.},

The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on Fermi in three months produced a deeper and better resolved map of the $\gamma$-ray sky than any previous space mission. We present here initial results for energies above 100 MeV for the 205 most significant (statistical significance greater than ~10$\sigma$) $\gamma$-ray sources in these data. These are the best characterized and best localized point-like (i.e., spatially unresolved) $\gamma$-ray sources in the early mission data.},

abstract = {This work reports on the discovery of HESS J1514-591, a VHE gamma-ray source found at the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) MSH 15-52 and its associated pulsar PSR B1509-58. The discovery was made with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), which currently provides the most sensitive measurement in the energy range of about 0.2-100 TeV. This analysis is the first to include all H.E.S.S. data from observations dedicated to MSH 15-52. The corresponding flux above 1 TeV is (4.4+/-0.2stat+/-1.0syst) x 10^{-12}cm^{-2}s^{-1}. The energy spectrum obeys a power-law with a differential flux at 1 TeV of (5.8+/-0.2stat+/-1.3syst) x 10^{-12}cm^{-2}s^{-1}TeV^{-1} and a photon index of 2.32+/-0.04stat+/-0.10syst. The gamma-ray emission extends along the pulsar jet, previously resolved in X-rays. This becomes more apparent after image deconvolution. The emission region along the jet axis decreases with increasing energy. An upper limit for the pulsed gamma-ray flux from PSR B1509-58 was calculated. Additional discussions include: the system of MSH 15-52 and PSR B1509-58, theory and methods of VHE gamma-ray astronomy and H.E.S.S., the first (Richardson-Lucy) deconvolution of VHE gamma-ray maps, search for pulsed emission from pulsars. The results are discussed within the framework of PWNs and are explained by inverse Compton scattering of leptons. A hadronic component is not excluded, but its gamma-ray emission would not be significant. Moreover, it is concluded that advection is the dominant transport mechanism over diffusion in the magnetized flow of the pulsar wind from PSR B1509-58. A correlation analysis with the Chandra X-ray data suggests that gamma radiation is emitted from the region of PSR B1509-58, but not from the neighboring optical nebula RCW 89.},

The two main structures of the remnant, the Southern Nebula, the plerion centered on the pulsar, and the Northern Nebula, are clearly visible in the MECS, with the former showing a much a harder spectrum. Furthermore, a diffuse extended emission surrounds the whole remnant up to ~ 17' from the center. Non-thermal flux is detected in the PDS up to 200 keV as well, and it appears that also in this energy range the emission is not concentrated in the central region around the pulsar. These data imply that the plerion extends up to a few tens of parsecs from the pulsar.},

abstract = {We present high-resolution ROSAT observations of PSR 1509-58 and the supernova remnant MSH 15-52. The pulsar itself is resolved from the surrounding synchrotron nebula as a 75 per cent pulsed point source. The synchrotron emission forms a broad, elongated cross centred on the pulsar, and an extrapolation of the north-western arm of the cross to the supernova remnant rim coincides with the RCW 89 H$\alpha$ nebula. More than half of the X-ray flux in RCW 89 is resolved into a partial ring of tight knots that closely follow the radio morphology of the region. We suggest that all of the X-ray emission in the field of PSR 1509-58 can be explained if the system is similar to the `torus' and `jets' of the Crab pulsar synchrotron nebula, but viewed at more than ~70 deg to the pulsar spin axis. For current theories, this inclination favours pulsar emission from the outer, rather than the inner, magnetosphere. The luminosity of RCW 89 is driven in our model by the pulsar wind, which suggests that the NW-SE axis of the synchrotron nebula marks a collimated outflow along the pulsar spin axis, making PSR 1509-58 the third example of an isolated pulsar with a polar outflow.},

A $\gamma$-ray signal is detected at the 25 sigma level during an exposure of 22.1 h live time. The image reveals an elliptically shaped emission region around the pulsar PSR B1509-58, with semi-major axis ~6' in the NW-SE direction and semi-minor axis ~2'. This morphology coincides with the diffuse pulsar wind nebula as observed at X-ray energies by ROSAT. The overall energy spectrum from 280 GeV up to 40 TeV can be fitted by a power law with photon index $\Gamma$=2.27$\pm$0.03stat$\pm$ 0.20syst.

abstract = {Energetic young pulsars and expanding blast waves [supernova remnants (SNRs)] are the most visible remains after massive stars, ending their lives, explode in core-collapse supernovae. The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope has unveiled a radio quiet pulsar located near the center of the compact synchrotron nebula inside the supernova remnant CTA 1. The pulsar, discovered through its gamma-ray pulsations, has a period of 316.86 milliseconds and a period derivative of 3.614 × 10‑13 seconds per second. Its characteristic age of 104 years is comparable to that estimated for the SNR. We speculate that most unidentified Galactic gamma-ray sources associated with star-forming regions and SNRs are such young pulsars.},

abstract = {The Vela pulsar is the brightest persistent source in the GeV sky and thus is the traditional first target for new $\gamma$-ray observatories. We report here on initial Fermi Large Area Telescope observations during verification phase pointed exposure and early sky survey scanning. We have used the Vela signal to verify Fermi timing and angular resolution. The high-quality pulse profile, with some 32,400 pulsed photons at E >= 0.03 GeV, shows new features, including pulse structure as fine as 0.3 ms and a distinct third peak, which shifts in phase with energy. We examine the high-energy behavior of the pulsed emission; initial spectra suggest a phase-averaged power-law index of $\Gamma$ = 1.51+0.05 -0.04 with an exponential cutoff at Ec = 2.9 $\pm$ 0.1 GeV. Spectral fits with generalized cutoffs of the form e^{-(E/E_c)^b} require b <= 1, which is inconsistent with magnetic pair attenuation, and thus favor outer-magnetosphere emission models. Finally, we report on upper limits to any unpulsed component, as might be associated with a surrounding pulsar wind nebula.},

abstract = {Pulsars steadily dissipate their rotational energy via relativistic winds. Confinement of these outflows generates luminous pulsar wind nebulae, seen across the electromagnetic spectrum in synchrotron and inverse Compton emission and in optical emission lines when they shock the surrounding medium. These sources act as important probes of relativistic shocks, particle acceleration, and interstellar gas. We review the many recent advances in the study of pulsar wind nebulae, with particular focus on the evolutionary stages through which these objects progress as they expand into their surroundings, and on morphological structures within these nebulae that directly trace the physical processes of particle acceleration and outflow. We conclude by considering some exciting new probes of pulsar wind nebulae, including the study of TeV gamma-ray emission from these sources, and observations of pulsar winds in close binary systems.},

abstract = {Massive star supernovae can be divided into four categories depending on the amount of mass loss from the progenitor star and the star's radius. Various aspects of the immediate aftermath of the supernova are expected to develop in different ways depending on the supernova category: mixing in the supernova, fallback on the central compact object, expansion of any pulsar wind nebula, interaction with circumstellar matter, and photoionization by shock breakout radiation. Models for observed young pulsar wind nebulae expanding into supernova ejecta indicate initial pulsar periods of 10-100 ms and approximate equipartition between particle and magnetic energies. Considering both pulsar nebulae and circumstellar interaction, the observed properties of young supernova remnants allow many of them to be placed in one of the supernova categories; the major categories are represented. The pulsar properties do not appear to be related to the supernova category.},

abstract = {We present a model of a pulsar wind nebula evolving inside its associated supernova remnant. The model uses a hydrodynamics code to simulate the evolution of this system when the pulsar has a high velocity. The simulation distinguishes four different stages of pulsar wind nebula evolution: the supersonic expansion stage, the reverse shock interaction stage, the subsonic expansion stage and ultimately the bow shock stage. The simulation bears out that, due to the high velocity of the pulsar, the position of the pulsar is off-centered with respect to its pulsar wind nebula, after the passage of the reverse shock. Subsequently the pulsar wind nebula expands subsonically until the event of the bow shock formation, when the motion of the pulsar becomes supersonic. The bow shock formation event occurs at roughly half the crossing time, when the pulsar is positioned at 0.677 times the radius of the supernova remnant blastwave, in complete agreement with analytical predictions. The crossing time is defined by the age of the supernova remnant when the pulsar overtakes the blastwave bounding the supernova remnant. The results of the model are applied to three supernova remnants: N157B, G327.1-1.1 and W44. We argue that the head of the pulsar wind nebula, containing the active pulsar, inside the first two systems is not bounded by a bow shock. However, in the case of W44 we argue for a scenario in which the pulsar wind nebula is bounded by a bow shock, due to the supersonic motion of the pulsar.},

abstract = {We report the results of Rosat PSPC observations of the Supernova Remnant MSH 15-52. We present morphological and spectral properties of this object that complement and, in some instances, modify the results obtained by previous observations. The two main components of the remnant, the synchrotron nebula and the thermal nebula, are embedded in an extended, basically symmetric, region of X-ray emission. A new extended structure is found in the south-east part of MSH 15-52. The spectral analysis shows a discrepancy (by a factor =~1.5) in the values of the hydrogen column density between the northern and southern components. Since the likelihood that the synchrotron nebula is coincidentally superposed on the other components is very remote, this disagreement may be related to peculiar physical properties of the emitting matter and of the surrounding medium. In particular, a contribution of a non-thermal component to the flux from the new extended symmetric nebula may be present.},

abstract = {We present observations with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by the energetic young pulsar B1509-58. These data confirm the complicated morphology of the system indicated by previous observations, and in addition reveal several new components to the nebula. The overall PWN shows a clear symmetry axis oriented at a position angle 150deg+/-5deg (north through east), which we argue corresponds to the pulsar spin axis. We show that a previously identified radio feature matches well with the overall extent of the X-ray PWN, and propose the former as the long-sought radio nebula powered by the pulsar. We further identify a bright collimated feature, at least 4' long, lying along the nebula's main symmetry axis; we interpret this feature as a physical outflow from the pulsar, and infer a velocity for this jet of greater than 0.2c. The lack of any observed counterjet implies that the pulsar spin axis is inclined at ~30$\,^{\circ}$ to the line of sight, contrary to previous estimates made from lower resolution data. We also identify a variety of compact features close to the pulsar. A pair of semicircular X-ray arcs lie 17" and 30" to the north of the pulsar; the latter arc shows a highly polarized radio counterpart. We show that these features can be interpreted as ion-compression wisps in a particle-dominated equatorial flow, and use their properties to infer a ratio of electromagnetic to particle energy in pairs at the wind shock $\sigma$~0.005, similar to that seen in the Crab Nebula. We further identify several compact knots seen very close to the pulsar; we use these to infer $\sigma$<0.003 at a separation from the pulsar of 0.1 pc.},

Both rely on using average values of key parameters, such as the mean signal lifetime of a communicating civilization. A more accurate answer must take into account the distribution of stellar, planetary and biological attributes in the galaxy, as well as the stochastic nature of evolution itself. This paper outlines a method of Monte Carlo realization that does this, and hence allows an estimation of the distribution of key parameters in SETI, as well as allowing a quantification of their errors (and the level of ignorance therein). Furthermore, it provides a means for competing theories of life and intelligence to be compared quantitatively.},

abstract = {A pulsar wind nebula (PWN) inside a supernova remnant provides a unique insight into the properties of the central neutron star, the relativistic wind powered by its loss of rotational energy, its progenitor supernova, and the surrounding environment. In this paper, we present a new semianalytic model for the evolution of such a PWN throughout its lifetime. This model couples the dynamical and radiative evolution of the PWNe, and predicts both the dynamical (e.g., radius and expansion velocity) and radiative (radio to TeV $\gamma$-ray spectrum) properties of the PWN during this period. As a result, it is well suited for using the observed properties of a PWN to constrain the physical characteristics of the neutron star, pulsar wind, progenitor supernova, and surrounding environment. We also discuss the expected evolution for a particular set of these parameters, and show that it reproduces the large spectral break inferred from the radio and X-ray spectrum of many young PWNe, and the low break frequency, low radio luminosity, high TeV $\gamma$-ray luminosity, and high magnetization observed for several older PWNe. The predicted spectrum of this PWN also contains spectral features which appear during different evolutionary phases detectable with new radio and $\gamma$-ray observing facilities such as the Extended Very Large Array and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Finally, this model has implications for determining if PWNe can inject a sufficient number of energetic electrons and positrons into their surroundings to explain the recent measurements of the cosmic-ray positron fraction by PAMELA and the cosmic-ray lepton spectrum by ATIC and HESS.},

abstract = {We report the detection of $\gamma$-ray pulsations (>=0.1 GeV) from PSR J2229+6114 and PSR J1048--5832, the latter having been detected as a low-significance pulsar by EGRET. Data in the $\gamma$-ray band were acquired by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, while the radio rotational ephemerides used to fold the $\gamma$-ray light curves were obtained using the Green Bank Telescope, the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank, and the Parkes Telescope. The two young radio pulsars, located within the error circles of the previously unidentified EGRET sources 3EG J1048--5840 and 3EG J2227+6122, present spin-down characteristics similar to the Vela pulsar. PSR J1048--5832 shows two sharp peaks at phases 0.15 $\pm$ 0.01 and 0.57 $\pm$ 0.01 relative to the radio pulse confirming the EGRET light curve, while PSR J2229+6114 presents a very broad peak at phase 0.49 $\pm$ 0.01. The $\gamma$-ray spectra above 0.1 GeV of both pulsars are fit with power laws having exponential cutoffs near 3 GeV, leading to integral photon fluxes of (2.19 $\pm$ 0.22 $\pm$ 0.32) × 10--7 cm--2 s--1 for PSR J1048--5832 and (3.77 $\pm$ 0.22 $\pm$ 0.44) × 10--7 cm--2 s--1 for PSR J2229+6114. The first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. PSR J1048--5832 is one of the two LAT sources which were entangled together as 3EG J1048--5840. These detections add to the growing number of young $\gamma$-ray pulsars that make up the dominant population of GeV $\gamma$-ray sources in the Galactic plane.},

abstract = {We report on $\gamma$-ray observations of the Crab Pulsar and Nebula using 8 months of survey data with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The high quality light curve obtained using the ephemeris provided by the Nan{\c c}ay and Jodrell Bank radio telescopes shows two main peaks stable in phase with energy. The first $\gamma$-ray peak leads the radio main pulse by (281 $\pm$ 12 $\pm$ 21) $\mu$s, giving new constraints on the production site of non-thermal emission in pulsar magnetospheres. The first uncertainty is due to $\gamma$-ray statistics, and the second arises from the rotation parameters. The improved sensitivity and the unprecedented statistics afforded by the LAT enable precise measurement of the Crab Pulsar spectral parameters: cut-off energy at Ec = (5.8 $\pm$ 0.5 $\pm$ 1.2) GeV, spectral index of $\Gamma$ = (1.97 $\pm$ 0.02 $\pm$ 0.06) and integral photon flux above 100 MeV of (2.09 $\pm$ 0.03 $\pm$ 0.18) × 10-6 cm-2 s-1. The first errors represent the statistical error on the fit parameters, while the second ones are the systematic uncertainties. Pulsed $\gamma$-ray photons are observed up to ~ 20 GeV which precludes emission near the stellar surface, below altitudes of around 4-5 stellar radii in phase intervals encompassing the two main peaks. A detailed phase-resolved spectral analysis is also performed: the hardest emission from the Crab Pulsar comes from the bridge region between the two $\gamma$-ray peaks while the softest comes from the falling edge of the second peak. The spectrum of the nebula in the energy range 100 MeV-300 GeV is well described by the sum of two power laws of indices $\Gamma$sync = (3.99 $\pm$ 0.12 $\pm$ 0.08) and $\Gamma$IC = (1.64 $\pm$ 0.05 $\pm$ 0.07), corresponding to the falling edge of the synchrotron and the rising edge of the inverse Compton (IC) components, respectively. This latter, which links up naturally with the spectral data points of Cherenkov experiments, is well reproduced via IC scattering from standard magnetohydrodynamic nebula models, and does not require any additional radiation mechanism.},

With the unprecedented angular resolution, effective area, field of view, and timing resolution, in the GeV band, of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the light curve of the Vela pulsar can be studied in greater detail than ever before. Using a timing solution derived solely from the LAT data, phase aligned with the radio emission, the spectrum of the Vela pulsar has been fit in intervals as small as 0.0016 in phase. Significant variation is seen in the cutoff energy and photon index across the light curve, strongly supporting curvature radiation as the source of the high-energy gamma-rays from the Vela pulsar.},

At the dawn of a new generation of gamma-ray telescopes, this review summarizes results from the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the principal predecessor mission studying high-energy photons in the 100 MeV energy range. EGRET viewed a gamma-ray sky dominated by prominent emission from the Milky Way, but featuring an array of other sources, including quasars, pulsars, gamma-ray bursts, and many sources that remain unidentified. A central feature of the EGRET results was the high degree of variability seen in many gamma-ray sources, indicative of the powerful forces at work in objects visible to gamma-ray telescopes. },

Further, measurement of phase-resolved spectra and energy dependent pulse profiles of the brighter pulsars should allow detailed tests of magnetospheric particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms, by comparing data with theoretical models that have been developed. },

abstract = { We present results of a 3D model of optical to gamma-ray emission from the slot gap accelerator of a rotation-powered pulsar. Primary electrons accelerating to high-altitudes in the unscreened electric field of the slot gap reach radiation-reaction limited Lorentz factors of 2 x 10^7, while electron-positron pairs from lower-altitude cascades flow along field lines interior to the slot gap. The curvature, synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation of both primary electrons and pairs produce a broad spectrum of emission from infra-red to GeV energies. Both primaries and pairs undergo cyclotron resonant absorption of radio photons, allowing them to maintain significant pitch angles. Synchrotron radiation from pairs with a power-law energy spectrum with Lorentz factors 10^2 - 10^5, dominate the spectrum up to 10 MeV. Synchrotron and curvature radiation of primaries dominates from 10 MeV up to a few GeV. We examine the energy-dependent pulse profiles and phase-resolved spectra for parameters of the Crab pulsar as a function of magnetic inclination and viewing angle, comparing to broad-band data. In most cases, the pulse profiles are dominated by caustics on trailing field lines. We also explore the relation of the high-energy and the radio profiles, as well as the possibility of caustic formation in the radio cone emission. We find that the Crab pulsar profiles and spectrum can be reasonably well reproduced by a model with viewing angle 45 degrees and inclination angle 100 or 80 degrees. This model predicts that the slot gap emission below 200 MeV will exhibit correlations in time and phase with the radio emission. },

abstract = { Shell-type Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been known to harbour a population of ultra-relativistic particles, accelerated in the Supernova shock wave by the mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration. Experimental evidence for the existence of electrons up to energies of ~100 TeV was first provided by the detection of hard X-ray synchrotron emission as e.g. in the shell of the young SNR SN1006. Furthermore using theoretical arguments shell-type Supernova remnants have long been considered as the main accelerator of protons - Cosmic rays - in the Galaxy; definite proof of this process is however still missing. Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWN) - diffuse structures surrounding young pulsars - are another class of objects known to be a site of particle acceleration in the Galaxy, again through the detection of hard synchrotron X-rays such as in the Crab Nebula. Gamma-rays above 100 MeV provide a direct access to acceleration processes. The GLAST Large Area telescope (LAT) will be operating in the energy range between 30 MeV and 300 GeV and will provide excellent sensitivity, angular and energy resolution in a previously rather poorly explored energy band. We will describe prospects for the investigation of these Galactic particle accelerators with GLAST. },

abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) are among the strongest candidates to explain the flux of cosmic rays below the knee around 10^15 eV. Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), synchrotron nebulae powered by the spin-down of energetic young pulsars, comprise one of the most populous VHE gamma-ray source classes. Gamma-ray studies in the GeV and TeV bands probe the nature (ions vs. electrons), production, and diffusion of high-energy particles in SNRs and PWNe. For sources that are visible across both the GeV and TeV bands, such as IC 443, the spatial and spectral distribution of gamma rays can be studied over an unprecedented energy range. This presentation will review recent VERITAS results, including studies of Cassiopeia A, IC 443, PSR J1930+1852, and the SNR G106.3+2.7/Boomerang region, and discuss prospects for complementary studies of SNRs and PWNe in the Fermi and VHE gamma-ray bands.},

abstract = {The third catalog of high-energy gamma-ray sources detected by the EGRET telescope on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory includes data from 1991 April 22 to 1995 October 3 (cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the mission). In addition to including more data than the second EGRET catalog and its supplement, this catalog uses completely reprocessed data (to correct a number of mostly minimal errors and problems). The 271 sources (E>100 MeV) in the catalog include the single 1991 solar flare bright enough to be detected as a source, the Large Magellanic Cloud, five pulsars, one probable radio galaxy detection (Cen A), and 66 high-confidence identifications of blazars (BL Lac objects, flat-spectrum radio quasars, or unidentified flat-spectrum radio sources). In addition, 27 lower confidence potential blazar identifications are noted. Finally, the catalog contains 170 sources not yet identified firmly with known objects, although potential identifications have been suggested for a number of those. A figure is presented that gives approximate upper limits for gamma-ray sources at any point in the sky, as well as information about sources listed in the second catalog and its supplement, that do not appear in this catalog.},

abstract = {Recent observations with atmospheric Cerenkov telescope systems such as H.E.S.S. and MAGIC have revealed a large number of new sources of very high energy (VHE) $\gamma$-rays from 100 GeV to 100 TeV, mostly concentrated along the Galactic plane. At lower energies (100 MeV to 10 GeV) the satellite-based instrument EGRET revealed a population of sources clustering along the Galactic plane. Given their adjacent energy bands, a systematic correlation study between the two source catalogs seems appropriate. Here, the populations of Galactic sources in both energy domains are characterized on observational as well as on phenomenological grounds. Surprisingly few common sources are found in terms of positional coincidence and spectral consistency. These common sources and their potential counterparts and emission mechanisms are discussed in detail. In cases of detection in only one energy band, for the first time consistent upper limits in the other energy band have been derived. The EGRET upper limits are rather unconstraining due to the sensitivity mismatch to current VHE instruments. The VHE upper limits put strong constraints on simple power-law extrapolation of several of the EGRET spectra and thus strongly suggest cutoffs in the unexplored energy range from 10 to 100 GeV. Physical reasons for the existence of cutoffs and for differences in the source population at GeV and TeV energies are discussed. Finally, predictions are derived for common GeV-TeV sources for the upcoming GLAST mission, bridging for the first time the energy gap between current GeV and TeV instruments.},

abstract = {Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are a prominent class of very high energy (E > 0.1 TeV) Galactic sources. Their $\gamma$-ray spectra are interpreted as due to inverse Compton scattering of ultrarelativistic electrons on the ambient photons, whereas the X-ray spectra are due to synchrotron emission. We investigate the relation between the $\gamma$- and X-ray emission and the pulsars' spin-down luminosity and characteristic age. We find that the distance-independent $\gamma$-ray to X-ray flux ratio of the nebulae is inversely proportional to the spin-down luminosity, (\propto \dot{E}^{-1.9}), while it appears proportional to the characteristic age, (vprop$\tau$2.2 c ), of the parent pulsar. We interpret these results as due to the evolution of the electron energy distribution and the nebular dynamics, supporting the idea of so-called relic PWNe. These empirical relations provide a new tool to classify unidentified diffuse $\gamma$-ray sources and to estimate the spin-down luminosity and characteristic age of rotation-powered pulsars with no detected pulsation from the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray properties of the associated PWNe. We apply these relations to predict the spin-down luminosity and characteristic age of four (so far unpulsing) candidate pulsars associated with wind nebulae.},

abstract = {We present new observations at high radio frequencies made with the Effelsberg 100 m radio telescope of the ``Boomerang'' pulsar wind nebula (PWN) G106.65+2.96, which is part of the supernova remnant (SNR) G106.3+2.7. Including low-frequency data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey allows us to develop a complete picture of the PWN and its evolution in a very complex environment. The radio continuum spectrum reveals a break between 4 and 5 GHz that is the result of synchrotron cooling. We find evidence that the reverse shock of the initial supernova shock wave has driven away the original PWN, which explains why the current nebula around the pulsar has such a low radio luminosity. An analysis of the energy budget of the pulsar, the magnetic field in the nebula, and the lifetime of relativistic electrons gives a magnetic field of 2.6 mG in the PWN with an age of 3900 yr. This is not the age of the SNR but the time that has passed since the reverse shock crushed the original PWN. A comparison of our polarization measurements with those of other PWNe leads to a simple model of the magnetic field structure within such an object. Using this model, we derive an angle of about 30$\,^{\circ}$ between the Galactic north and the spin axis of the pulsar, projected onto the plane of the sky. The spin axis is pointing away from us, toward the northwest. This agrees nicely with the results of Ng and Romani, who in a 2004 paper calculated an angle of 20$\,^{\circ}$ from their fits of a model torus to a Chandra measurement of the Boomerang. The nebula contains a toroidal magnetic field structure, yet the rotation measure distribution indicates a radial magnetic field as its cause. Apparently, the observed radio emission originates on the far side of the object and passes through the inner region, which has a radial magnetic field.},

abstract = { In this review paper on pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) we discuss the properties of such nebulae within the context of containment against cross-field diffusion (versus normal advection), the effect of reverse shocks on the evolution of offset ``Vela-like'' PWN, constraints on maximum particle energetics, magnetic field strength estimates based on spectral and spatial properties, and the implication of such field estimates on the composition of the wind. A significant part of the discussion is based on the High Energy Stereoscopic System ({\it H.E.S.S.} or {\it HESS}) detection of the two evolved pulsar wind nebulae Vela X (cocoon) and HESS J1825-137. In the case of Vela X (cocoon) we also review evidence of a hadronic versus a leptonic interpretation, showing that a leptonic interpretation is favored for the {\it HESS} signal. The constraints discussed in this review paper sets a general framework for the interpretation of a number of offset, filled-center nebulae seen by {\it HESS}. These sources are found along the galactic plane with galactic latitudes $|b|\sim 0$, where significant amounts of molecular gas is found. In these regions, we find that the interstellar medium is inhomogeneous, which has an effect on the morphology of supernova shock expansion. One consequence of this effect is the formation of offset pulsar wind nebulae as observed. },

abstract = {We report on gamma-ray observations in the off-pulse window of the Vela pulsar PSR B0833-45, using 11 months of survey data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). This pulsar is located in the 8 degree diameter Vela supernova remnant, which contains several regions of non-thermal emission detected in the radio, X-ray and gamma-ray bands. The gamma-ray emission detected by the LAT lies within one of these regions, the 2*3 degrees area south of the pulsar known as Vela-X. The LAT flux is signicantly spatially extended with a best-fit radius of 0.88 +/- 0.12 degrees for an assumed radially symmetric uniform disk. The 200 MeV to 20 GeV LAT spectrum of this source is well described by a power-law with a spectral index of 2.41 +/- 0.09 +/- 0.15 and integral flux above 100 MeV of (4.73 +/- 0.63 +/- 1.32) * 10^{-7} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The first errors represent the statistical error on the fit parameters, while the second ones are the systematic uncertainties. Detailed morphological and spectral analyses give strong constraints on the energetics and magnetic field of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) system and favor a scenario with two distinct electron populations.},

This hints at an independent synchrotron emission feature in the Crab Nebula. The flux in the 0.3-10GeV interval is a factor ~3 larger than the predicted inverse Compton flux, which indicates that the field in the outer nebula decreases faster than predicted by MHD flow soultions. The OSSE detection of the Vela SNR is (spectrally) consistent with emission from the 1' radius compact nebula. The EGRET upper limit constrains the maximum particle energy in this compact nebula to values below the full polar cap potential drop. However, inverse Compton emission from the Vela X radio nebula is also expected in the EGRET range, leading to a constraint on the radio break frequency and nebular magnetic field strength.},

abstract = {We have generated a molecular cloud catalog from the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory Outer Galaxy Survey of 12CO (J=1-0) emission using a two-phase object identification procedure. The first phase consists of grouping pixels into contiguous structures above a radiation temperature threshold of 0.8 K. The second phase decomposes the first-phase objects by an enhanced version of the CLUMPFIND algorithm, using dynamic thresholding, and again with a threshold of 0.8 K used for discrimination. A detailed comparison of our method with the CLUMPFIND algorithm is given, highlighting the advantages of the use of dynamic (rather than quantized) thresholding. Basic attributes of the clouds-coordinates, bounding boxes, integrated intensities, peak observed temperatures-are tabulated in the catalog. A two-dimensional elliptical Gaussian is fitted to the velocity-integrated map of each cloud; the major and minor axis sizes and major axis position angles thus derived are included in the catalog. To the spatially integrated emission line of each cloud, a Gaussian profile is fitted to measure the global linewidth. Model Gaussian clouds, truncated at 0.8 K, are examined to determine the effects of biases on measured quantities, induced by truncation. Coupled with detailed analysis of the cataloged clouds, statistical corrections for the effects of truncation on measured sizes, linewidths, and integrated intensities are derived and applied, along with corrections for the effects of finite resolution on the measured attributes. The cataloged emission accounts for 76.4% of the total emission in the Outer Galaxy Survey. The deficit is shown to arise mainly from low-intensity emission on the periphery of larger objects, rather than from a large number of small and/or low-intensity features. From the measured parameters, Gaussian reconstructions of the emission are carried out, and these compare favorably to the raw data. A detailed analysis of the decomposition in complex regions is performed, showing that severe truncation at levels much in excess of 0.8 K is countered by the operation of a ``thermostat,'' resulting in concatenation of emission into a larger object if severe blending is present, rather than the identification of a number of smaller, more heavily truncated objects. Two other tests are carried out: (1) an association test that examines the utility of using the decomposed 12CO (J=1-0) emission, in comparison to CS emission, to identify possible sites of star formation as traced by IRAS point sources; (2) a test comparison of 12CO and 13CO decompositions to gauge the effects of emission saturation and blending. Overall, the results of these two tests show that emission enhancements in 12CO (J=1-0) emission, induced by internal heating by embedded star formation, are in general usefully recorded in the decomposition, but that emission blending and saturation on scales of ~few arcminutes in complex regions can limit the precision to which associations with other tracers can be made. A statistical approach to source association that makes good use of the information contained in the catalog is developed and described. The new 12CO cloud catalog, as a concise description of the OGS data, will facilitate intercomparisons of molecular clouds with other ISM components, available at comparable resolution within the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey. The catalog covers the Galactic longitude range 102.5d to 141.5d, Galactic latitude range -3$\,^{\circ}$ to +5.4d, and lsr velocity range +20.8 to -120.2 km s-1 and contains 14,592 objects. Due to its size, and for ease of access, the catalog is made available in electronic form.},

abstract = {We present high-resolution Chandra X-ray observations of PSR B0833-45, the 89 ms pulsar associated with the Vela supernova remnant. We have acquired two observations separated by 1 month to search for changes in the pulsar and its environment following an extreme glitch in its rotation frequency. We find a well-resolved nebula with a toroidal morphology remarkably similar to that observed in the Crab Nebula, along with an axial Crab-like jet. Between the two observations, taken ~3×105 s and ~3×106 s after the glitch, the flux from the pulsar is found to be steady to within 0.75% the 3 $\sigma$ limit on the fractional increase in the pulsar's X-ray flux is <~10-5 of the inferred glitch energy. We use this limit to constrain parameters of glitch models and neutron star structure. We do find a significant increase in the flux of the nebula's outer arc; if associated with the glitch, the inferred propagation velocity is >~0.7c, similar to that seen in the brightening of the Crab Nebula wisps. We propose an explanation for the X-ray structure of the Vela synchrotron nebula based on a model originally developed for the Crab Nebula. In this model, the bright X-ray arcs are the shocked termination of a relativistic equatorial pulsar wind that is contained within the surrounding kidney-bean shaped synchrotron nebula comprising the postshock, but still relativistic, flow. In a departure from the Crab model, the magnetization parameter $\sigma$ of the Vela pulsar wind is allowed to be of order unity; this is consistent with the simplest MHD transport of magnetic field from the pulsar to the nebula, where B<=4×10-4 G. The inclination angle of the axis of the equatorial torus with respect to the line of sight is identical to that of the rotation axis of the pulsar as previously measured from the polarization of the radio pulse. The projection of the rotation axis on the sky may also be close to the direction of proper motion of the pulsar if previous radio measurements were confused by orthogonal-mode polarized components. We review effects that may enhance the probability of alignment between the spin axis and space velocity of a pulsar, and speculate that short-period, slowly moving pulsars are just the ones best-suited to producing synchrotron nebulae with such aligned structures. Previous interpretations of the compact Vela nebula as a bow-shock in a very weakly magnetized wind suffered from data of inadequate spatial resolution and less plausible physical assumptions.},

Their toroidal morphologies can help determine the geometry of the pulsar which is useful for constraining models of pulsed $\gamma$-ray emission. Rapidly moving PWN (RPWN) with more cometary morphologies seem to be associated with variable EGRET sources in regions where the ambient medium is dense compared to what is typical for the ISM.},

abstract = {The Vela supernova remnant (SNR) is a complex region containing a number of sources of non-thermal radiation. The inner section of this SNR, within 2 degrees of the pulsar PSR B0833-45, has been observed by the HESS $\gamma$-ray atmospheric Cherenkov detector in 2004 and 2005. A strong signal is seen from an extended region to the south of the pulsar, within an integration region of radius 0.8$\,^{\circ}$ around the position ($\alpha$ = 08h 35m 00s, $\delta$ = -45$\,^{\circ}$ 36 arcmin J2000.0). The excess coincides with a region of hard X-ray emission seen by the ROSAT and ASCA satellites. The observed energy spectrum of the source between 550 GeV and 65 TeV is well fit by a power law function with photon index $\Gamma$ = 1.45 $\pm$ 0.09 stat $\pm$ 0.2sys and an exponential cutoff at an energy of 13.8 $\pm$ 2.3stat $\pm$ 4.1sys TeV. The integral flux above 1 TeV is (1.28 $\pm$ 0.17stat $\pm$ 0.38sys) × 10-11cm-2 s-1. This result is the first clear measurement of a peak in the spectral energy distribution from a VHE $\gamma$-ray source, likely related to inverse Compton emission. A fit of an Inverse Compton model to the HESS spectral energy distribution gives a total energy in non-thermal electrons of ~2 × 1045 erg between 5 TeV and 100 TeV, assuming a distance of 290 parsec to the pulsar. The best fit electron power law index is 2.0, with a spectral break at 67 TeV.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the direction of the SNR G54.1+0.3 using the VERITAS ground-based gamma-ray observatory. The TeV signal has an overall significance of 6.8$\sigma$ and appears point-like given the 5$^{arcminute}$ resolution of the instrument. The integral flux above 1 TeV is 2.5\% of the Crab Nebula flux and significant emission is measured between 250 GeV and 4 TeV, well described by a power-law energy spectrum dN/dE $\sim$ E$^{-\Gamma}$ with a photon index $\Gamma= 2.39\pm0.23_{stat}\pm0.30_{sys}$. We find no evidence of time variability among observations spanning almost two years. Based on the location, the morphology, the measured spectrum, the lack of variability and a comparison with similar systems previously detected in the TeV band, the most likely counterpart of this new VHE gamma-ray source is the PWN in the SNR G54.1+0.3. The measured X-ray to VHE gamma-ray luminosity ratio is the lowest among all the nebulae supposedly driven by young rotation-powered pulsars, which could indicate a particle-dominated PWN.},

abstract = {G54.1+0.3 is a young pulsar wind nebula (PWN), closely resembling the Crab, for which no thermal shell emission has been detected in X-rays. Recent Spitzer observations revealed an infrared (IR) shell containing a dozen point sources arranged in a ring-like structure, previously proposed to be young stellar objects. An extended knot of emission located in the NW part of the shell appears to be aligned with the pulsar's X-ray jet, suggesting a possible interaction with the shell material. Surprisingly, the IR spectrum of the knot resembles the spectrum of freshly formed dust in Cas A, and is dominated by an unidentified dust emission feature at 21 $\mu$m. The spectra of the shell also contain various emission lines and show that some are significantly broadened, suggesting that they originate in rapidly expanding supernova (SN) ejecta. We present the first evidence that the PWN is driving shocks into expanding SN ejecta and we propose an alternative explanation for the origin of the IR emission in which the shell is composed entirely of SN ejecta. In this scenario, the freshly formed SN dust is being heated by early-type stars belonging to a cluster in which the SN exploded. Simple dust models show that this interpretation can give rise to the observed shell emission and the IR point sources.},

abstract = {We present a Chandra X-ray observation of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray source HESS J1640 - 465. We identify a point source surrounded by a diffuse emission that fills the extended object previously detected by XMM-Newton at the centroid of the HESS source, within the shell of the radio supernova remnant (SNR) G338.3 - 0.0. The morphology of the diffuse emission strongly resembles that of a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and extends asymmetrically to the southwest of a point source presented as a potential pulsar. The spectrum of the putative pulsar and compact nebula are well characterized by an absorbed power-law model which, for a reasonable N H value of 14 × 1022 cm-2, exhibit an index of 1.1 and 2.5 respectively, typical of Vela-like PWNe. We demonstrate that, given the H I absorption features observed along the line of sight, the SNR and the H II surrounding region are probably connected and lie between 8 kpc and 13 kpc. The resulting age of the system is between 10 and 30 kyr. For a 10 kpc distance (also consistent with the X-ray absorption) the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosities of the putative pulsar and nebula are L PSR ~ 1.3 × 1033 d 2 10 kpc erg s-1 and L PWN ~ 3.9 × 1033 d 2 10 erg s-1 (d 10 = d/10 kpc). Both the flux ratio of L PWN/L PSR ~ 3.4 and the total luminosity of this system predict a pulsar spin-down power around \dot{E} \sim 4 \times 10^{36}\;erg\;s^{-1}. We finally consider several reasons for the asymmetries observed in the PWN morphology and discuss the potential association with the HESS source in terms of a time-dependent one-zone leptonic model.},

abstract = {We model the broadband emission from supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 including, for the first time, a consistent calculation of thermal X-ray emission together with non-thermal emission in a nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration model. Our model tracks the evolution of the SNR including the plasma ionization state between the forward shock and the contact discontinuity. We use a plasma emissivity code to predict the thermal X-ray emission spectrum assuming the initially cold electrons are heated either by Coulomb collisions with the shock-heated protons (the slowest possible heating), or come into instant equilibration with the protons. For either electron heating model, electrons reach gsim107 K rapidly and the X-ray line emission near 1 keV is more than 10 times as luminous as the underlying thermal bremsstrahlung continuum. Since recent Suzaku observations show no detectable line emission, this places strong constraints on the unshocked ambient medium density and on the relativistic electron-to-proton ratio. For the uniform circumstellar medium (CSM) models that we consider, the low densities and high relativistic electron-to-proton ratios required to match the Suzaku X-ray observations definitively rule out pion decay as the emission process producing GeV-TeV photons. We show that leptonic models, where inverse-Compton scattering against the cosmic background radiation dominates the GeV-TeV emission, produce better fits to the broadband thermal and non-thermal observations in a uniform CSM.},

abstract = {Nonthermal X-ray emission in some supernova remnants originates from synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic particles in turbulent magnetic fields. We address the effect of a random magnetic field on synchrotron emission images and spectra. A random magnetic field is simulated to construct synchrotron emission maps of a source with a steady distribution of ultrarelativistic electrons. Nonsteady localized structures (dots, clumps, and filaments), in which the magnetic field reaches exceptionally high values, typically arise in the random field sample. These magnetic field concentrations dominate the synchrotron emission (integrated along the line of sight) from the highest energy electrons in the cutoff regime of the distribution, resulting in an evolving, intermittent, clumpy appearance. The simulated structures resemble those observed in X-ray images of some young supernova remnants. The lifetime of X-ray clumps can be short enough to be consistent with that observed even in the case of a steady particle distribution. The efficiency of synchrotron radiation from the cutoff regime in the electron spectrum is strongly enhanced in a turbulent field compared to emission from a uniform field of the same magnitude.},

abstract = {We present a three-dimensional model of supernova remnants (SNRs) in which the hydrodynamical evolution of the remnant is modeled consistently with nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration occurring at the outer blast wave. The model includes particle escape and diffusion outside of the forward shock and particle interactions with arbitrary distributions of external ambient material, such as molecular clouds. We include synchrotron emission and cooling, bremsstrahlung radiation, neutral pion production, and inverse Compton (IC) and Coulomb energy loss. Broadband spectra have been calculated for typical parameters, including dense regions of gas external to a 1000 yr old SNR. In this paper, we describe the details of our model, but do not attempt a detailed fit to any specific remnant. We also do not include magnetic field amplification (MFA), even though this effect may be important in some young remnants. Our aim is to develop a flexible platform that can be generalized to include effects such as MFA, and that can be easily adapted to various SNR environments, including Type Ia SNRs, which explode in a constant-density medium, and Type II SNRs, which explode in a presupernova wind. When applied to a specific SNR, our model will predict cosmic-ray spectra and multiwavelength morphology in projected images for instruments with varying spatial and spectral resolutions. We show examples of these spectra and images and emphasize the importance of measurements in the hard X-ray, GeV, and TeV gamma-ray bands for investigating key ingredients in the acceleration mechanism, and for deducing whether or not TeV emission is produced by IC from electrons or pion decay from protons.},

More than 90% of the gas-related emissivity above 1 GeV is attributed to gamma-rays from the decay of neutral pions formed in collisions between cosmic rays and interstellar matter, with lepton-induced processes becoming increasingly important below 1 GeV. The elementary kinematics of neutral pion production and decay are re-examined in light of two physics questions: does isobaric production follow a scaling behavior? and what is the minimum proton kinetic energy needed to make a gamma-ray of a certain energy formed through intermediate pi0 production? The emissivity spectrum will allow the interstellar cosmic-ray spectrum to be determined reliably, providing a reference for origin and propagation studies as well as input to solar modulation models. A method for such an analysis and illustrative results are presented.},

abstract = {We present new observational and modeling results obtained for the Galactic nonthermal radio source G328.4+0.2. Using X-ray data obtained by XMM-Newton, we confirm that its X-ray emission is heavily absorbed, has a spectrum best fitted by a power-law model of photon index $\Gamma$=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, comes from a region significantly smaller than the radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emissions are significantly offset from each other. We also present the results of a new high-resolution (7") 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using ATCA and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes radio telescope. By comparing this 1.4 GHz image with a similar resolution image at 4.8 GHz, we find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum ($\alpha$~0 S$\nu$~$\nu$$\alpha$). Additionally, we are able to limit the pseudoluminosity of any pulsar to L1400≡S1400400d2<~30 mJy kpc2 for the central radio pulsar, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these observational results, we test whether G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula or an SNR that contains a large pulsar wind nebula using a simple hydrodynamic model for the evolution of a pulsar wind nebula inside an SNR. As a result of this analysis, we conclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (<~10,000 years old) pulsar wind nebula formed by a low magnetic field (<~1012 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly (<~10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>~1051 ergs), low ejecta mass (Mej<~5 Msolar) supernova explosion that occurred in a low-density (n~0.03 cm-3) environment.},

abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds are potentially exciting systems in which to detect evidence of cosmic ray acceleration. Prominent $\gamma$-ray emission is produced via the decay of neutral pions when cosmic rays encounter nearby dense clouds. In many of the SNRs coincident with $\gamma$-ray sources, the presence of OH (1720 MHz) masers is used to identify interaction with dense gas and to provide a kinematic distance to the system. In this Letter we use statistical tests to demonstrate that there is a correlation between these masers and a class of GeV- to TeV-energy $\gamma$-ray sources coincident with interacting remnants. For pion decay the $\gamma$-ray luminosity provides a direct estimate of the local cosmic ray density. We find the cosmic ray density is enhanced by one to two orders of magnitude over the local solar value, comparable to X-ray-induced ionization in these remnants. The inferred ionization rates are sufficient to explain non-equilibrium chemistry in the post-shock gas, where high columns of hydroxyl are observed.},

abstract = {PSR J0108-1431 is a nearby, 170 Myr old, very faint radio pulsar near the "pulsar death line" in the P-\dot{P} diagram. We observed the pulsar field with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and detected a point source (53 counts in a 30 ks exposure; energy flux (9 $\pm$ 2) × 10-15 erg cm-2 s-1 in the 0.3-8 keV band) close to the radio pulsar position. Based on the large X-ray/optical flux ratio at the X-ray source position, we conclude that the source is the X-ray counterpart of PSR J0108-1431. The pulsar spectrum can be described by a power-law model with photon index $\Gamma$ ≈ 2.2 and luminosity L 0.3-8 keV ≈ 2 × 1028 d 2 130 erg s-1, or by a blackbody model with temperature kT ≈ 0.28 keV and bolometric luminosity L bol ≈ 1.3 × 1028 d 2 130 erg s-1, for a plausible hydrogen column density N H = 7.3 × 1019 cm-2 (d 130 = d/130 pc). The pulsar converts ~0.4% of its spin-down power into X-ray luminosity, i.e., its X-ray efficiency is higher than for most younger pulsars. From the comparison of the X-ray position with the previously measured radio positions, we estimated the pulsar proper motion of 0.2 arcsec yr-1 (V bottom ≈ 130d 130 km s-1), in the south-southeast direction.},

abstract = {We investigate the radiation processes inside supernova remnants which are powered by young pulsars. Using a recent model for particle acceleration by the pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), in which positrons gain energy in the process of resonant scattering by the heavy nuclei, we construct a time-dependent radiation model for the PWNe. In this model, the spectra of relativistic particles, injected inside the nebula, depend on time due to the evolution of the pulsar parameters. Applying a simple model for the evolution of the PWNa, the equilibrium spectra of leptons and nuclei inside the nebula are determined as a function of time, taking into account the energy losses of particles on different processes and their escape from the nebula. We calculate the multiwavelength photon spectra produced by leptons and nuclei and compare them with the observations of the PWNe for which TeV gamma -ray emission has been reported, i.e. the Crab Nebula, the Vela Supernova Remnant, and the nebula around PSR 1706-44. It is found that the emission from the Crab Nebula can be well fitted by the composition of the gamma -ray emission produced by leptons (below ~ 10 TeV) and nuclei ( ~ 10 TeV). The model is further tested by successful fitting of the high energy spectrum from the Vela SNR. In this case, the observed gamma -ray emission is mainly due to leptons and the contribution of gamma -rays from decay of neutral pions, produced in collision of nuclei, is significantly lower. However, the considered model does not give good fitting to the emission from PSR1706-44 for the likely parameters of this source, unless an additional target for relativistic leptons is present inside the nebula, e.g. the thermal infrared emission. Based on the knowledge obtained from these fittings, we predict the gamma -ray fluxes in the TeV energy range from other PWNe, which are promissing TeV gamma -ray sources due to their similarities to the gamma -ray nebulae, i.e. MSH15-52 (PSR 1509-58), 3C58 (PSR J0205+6449), and CTB80 (PSR 1951+32). Possible detection of these sources by the new generation of Cherenkov telescopes is discussed.},

abstract = {Aims: We develop a set of diagnostic tools for synchrotron-emitting sources, presented in a previous paper, to include a computation of inverse-Compton radiation from the same relativistic particles that give rise to the synchrotron emission. For the first time, we then study the gamma-ray emission properties of Pulsar Wind Nebulae, in the context of the axisymmetric jet-torus scenario. Methods: We evolve the relativistic MHD equations and the maximum energy of the emitting particles, including adiabatic and synchrotron losses along streamlines. The particle energy distribution function is split into two components: one corresponds to radio-emitting electrons, which are interpreted to be a relic population that is born at the outburst of the supernova, and the other is associated with a wind population that is continuously accelerated at the termination shock and emits up to the gamma-ray band. The inverse Compton emissivity is calculated using the general Klein-Nishina differential cross-section and three different photon targets for the relativistic particles are considered: the nebular synchrotron photons, photons associated with the far-infrared thermal excess, and the cosmic microwave background. Results: When the method is applied to the simulations that match the optical and X-ray morphology of the Crab Nebula, the overall synchrotron spectrum can only be fitted assuming an excess of injected particles and a steeper power law (E-2.7) with respect to previous models. The resulting TeV emission has then the correct shape but is in excess of the data. This is related to the magnetic-field structure in the nebula, derived using simulations: in particular, the field is strongly compressed close to the termination shock, but with a lower than expected volume average. The jet-torus structure is also found to be visible clearly in high-resolution gamma-ray synthetic maps. We present a preliminary exploration of time variability in X- and gamma-rays. We find variations with timescales of about 2 years in both bands. The variability observed originates in the strongly time-dependent MHD motions inside the nebula.

The proposed method is quite general, and can be applied to any scheme for RMHD and to all non-thermal emitting sources, e.g. pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), and in particular to the Crab Nebula (CN) as in the present proceeding. Here only the linear optical and X-ray polarization that characterizes the PWNe synchrotron emission is analyzed in order to infer information on the inner bulk flow structure, to provide a direct investigation of the magnetic field configuration, in particular the presence and the strength of a poloidal component, and to understand the origin of some emitting features, such as the knot, whose origins are still uncertain. The inverse Compton radiation is examined to disentangle the different contributions to radiation from the magnetic field and the particle energy distribution function, and to search for a possible hadronic component in the emitting PWN, and thus for the presence of ions in the wind. If hadronic radiation was found in a PWN, young supernova remnants would provide a natural birth-place of the cosmic-rays (CRs) up to the so-called knee in the CR spectrum.},

Our goal is to provide a simplified theoretical description that can be used as a tool to put constraints on unknown properties of PWN-SNR systems: a piece of work that is preliminary to any more accurate and sophisticated modeling. In the present paper we apply the newly developed model to a few objects of different ages and luminosities. We find that an injection spectrum in the form of a broken-power law gives a satisfactory description of the emission for all the systems we consider. More surprisingly, we also find that the intrinsic spectral break turns out to be at a similar energy for all sources, in spite of the differences mentioned above. We discuss the implications of our findings on the workings of pulsar magnetospheres, pair multiplicity and on the particle acceleration mechanism(s) that might be at work at the pulsar wind termination shock.},

abstract = {It has long been speculated that supernova remnants represent a major source of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. Observations over the past decade have ceremoniously unveiled direct evidence of particle acceleration in SNRs to energies approaching the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum. Nonthermal X-ray emission from shell-type SNRs reveals multi-TeV electrons, and the dynamical properties of several SNRs point to efficient acceleration of ions. Observations of TeV gamma-ray emission have confirmed the presence of energetic particles in several remnants as well, but there remains considerable debate as to whether this emission originates with high energy electrons or ions. Equally uncertain are the exact conditions that lead to efficient particle acceleration. Based on the catalog of EGRET sources, we know that there is a large population of Galactic gamma-ray sources whose distribution is similar to that of SNRs. With the increased resolution and sensitivity of GLAST, the gamma-ray SNRs from this population will be identified. Their detailed emission structure, along with their spectra, will provide the link between their environments and their spectra in other wavebands to constrain emission models and to potentially identify direct evidence of ion acceleration in SNRs. Here I summarize recent observational and theoretical work in the area of cosmic ray acceleration by SNRs, and discuss the contributions GLAST will bring to our understanding of this problem.},

abstract = {We study the nonthermal emission of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) from radio to TeV $\gamma$-ray energies with a simplified time-dependent injection model. In this model, a relativistic wind of particles driven by a central pulsar with a spin-down power L(t) is blown into the ambient medium and a shock wave is formed, which accelerates the particles to very high energies through the Fermi acceleration mechanism in the PWN. The relativistic particles in the PWN therefore consist of two components, one coming directly from the pulsar magnetosphere and the other from shock acceleration in the PWN. The model PWN spectra follow a broken power law with different indices and a break energy Eb. The accelerated particles produce nonthermal photons through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering off soft photon fields. We apply this model to the Crab Nebula, the PWN in MSH 15-52, and HESS J1825-137, which have all been found to emit very high energy (VHE) photons. Our results indicate that (1) the observed data, ranging from radio to VHE $\gamma$-rays, for the Crab Nebula can be reproduced by this model, where the emission from radio to medium-energy $\gamma$-rays is from the synchrotron emission due to the injected electrons, whereas the high-energy photons primarily come from inverse Compton scattering of the high-energy electrons on synchrotron photons; and (2) the TeV emission from the PWN in MSH 15-52 and HESS J1825-137 mainly comes from the inverse Compton scattering of the high-energy electrons on infrared photons.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of optical emission knots associated with the young Galactic supernova remnant 3C 58. H$\alpha$ images show hundreds of clumpy filaments and knots arranged in a complex structure covering a nearly circular area roughly 400" in diameter. A quite different emission structure is seen in [O III], where the brightest features are less clumpy and largely confined to the remnant's northwest quadrant. Measured radial velocities of over 450 knots reveal two distinct kinematic populations; one with average and peak expansion velocities of 770 and 1100 km s-1, respectively, forming a thick shell, and the other showing |v|<=250 km s-1. High-velocity knots (|v|>=500 km s-1) exhibit a strong bipolar expansion pattern with redshifted and blueshifted knots located in northeastern and southwestern regions, respectively. These knots also show strong [N II]/H$\alpha$ line emission ratios, suggesting enhanced N/H. In contrast, the slower expanding knot population shows much lower [N II]/H$\alpha$ line ratios and likely represents circumstellar mass loss material from the 3C 58 progenitor. Proper-motion estimates using images spanning a 28 yr time interval suggest positional shifts of between 0.5" and 2.0", implying proper motions of 0.02"-0.07" yr-1. These values agree with previous estimates but are much less than the ~0.2" yr-1 expected if 3C 58 were associated with historic guest star of 1181 CE.},

abstract = {Expressions are derived for the total energy loss and photon-production spectrum by the processes of Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and synchrotron radiation from highly relativistic electrons. For Compton scattering, the general case, the Thomson limit, and the extreme Klein-Nishina limit are considered. Bremsstrahlung is treated for the cases where the electron is scattered by a pure Coulomb field and by an atom. For the latter case the effects of shielding are discussed extensively. The synchrotron spectrum is derived for an electron moving in a circular orbit perpendicular to the magnetic field and also for the general case where the electron's motion is helical. The total photon-production spectrum is derived for each process when there is a power-law distribution of electron energies. The problems of the effects of the three processes on the electron distribution itself are considered. It is shown that if the electron loses a small fraction of its energy in a single occurrence of a process, the electron distribution function satisfies a continuity equation which is a differential equation in energy space. For the more general case where the electron can lose energy in discrete amounts (as in bremsstrahlung and extreme Klein-Nishina Compton losses), the electron distribution function satisfies an integro-differential equation. Some approximate solutions to this equation are derived for certain special cases.},

abstract = {Deep X-ray imaging spectroscopy of the bright pulsar wind nebula 3C 58 confirms the existence of an embedded thermal X-ray shell surrounding the pulsar PSR J0205+6449. Radially resolved spectra obtained with the XMM-Newton telescope are well characterized by a power-law model with the addition of a soft thermal emission component in varying proportions. These fits reproduce the well-studied increase in the spectral index with radius attributed to synchrotron burn off of high energy electrons. Most interestingly, a radially resolved thermal component is shown to map out a shell-like structure ~6' in diameter. The presence of a strong emission line corresponding to the Ne IX He-like transition requires an overabundance of ~3×(Ne/Nesolar) in the Raymond-Smith plasma model. The best-fit temperature kT~0.23 keV is essentially independent of radius for the derived column density of NH=(4.2+/-0.1)×1021 cm-2. Our result suggests that thermal shells can be obscured in the early evolution of a supernova remnant by nonthermal pulsar wind nebulae emission; the luminosity of the 3C 58 shell is more than an order of magnitude below the upper limit on a similar shell in the Crab Nebula. We find the shell centroid to be offset from the pulsar location. If this neutron star has a velocity similar to that of the Crab pulsar, we derive an age of 3700 yr and a velocity vector aligned with the long axis of the PWN. The shell parameters and pulsar offset add to the accumulating evidence that 3C 58 is not the remnant of the supernova of CE 1181.},

abstract = {New 1.4 GHz VLA observations of the pulsar-powered supernova remnant 3C 58 have resulted in the highest quality radio images of this object to date. The images show filamentary structure over the body of the nebula. The present observations were combined with earlier ones from 1984 and 1991 to investigate the variability of the radio emission on a variety of timescales. No significant changes are seen over a 110 day interval. In particular, the upper limit on the apparent projected velocity of the wisp is 0.05c. The expansion rate of the radio nebula was determined between 1984 and 2004 and is 0.014%+/-0.003% yr-1, corresponding to a velocity of 630+/-70 km s-1 along the major axis. If 3C 58 is the remnant of SN 1181, it must have been strongly decelerated, which is unlikely given the absence of emission from the supernova shell. Alternatively, the low expansion speed and a number of other arguments suggest that 3C 58 may be several thousand years old and not the remnant of SN 1181.},

Such a remnant consists of both a plerionic and a shell-type component, corresponding to the pulsar wind nebula driven by the spin-down luminosity of the central pulsar and the blast wave bounding the supernova remnant, respectively. Theoretical investigations including hydrodynamical simulations have shown that, at late times (~1000-10,000 yr), a simple scaling law connects the radius of the supernova shell to the radius of the plerion. The energy content of the plerion and the total mechanical energy of the supernova remnant enter into this scaling law. One can use this scaling law to estimate the initial spin periods of pulsars residing in composite remnants. We discuss potential pitfalls of this method, including the effect of a small remnant age and of strong radiative losses in the plerion.},

This finding holds as long as the lifetime of inverse Compton emitting electrons exceeds the age of the system. For a typical $\gamma$-2 electron spectrum, the predicted flux depends mostly on the pulsar birth period, conversion efficiency of spin-down power to relativistic electrons, and distance to the PWN, so that first-order analytic estimates of the birth period can be assessed from GLAST LAT observations of PWNe. The associated (``uncooled'') photon spectral index in the GeV domain is expected to cluster around ~1.5, which is bounded at low energies by an intrinsic spectral break, and at higher energies by a second spectral break where the photon index steepens to ~2 due to radiation losses. However, if the spectral parameters deviate from the above-mentioned assumptions, we can combine GLAST LAT observations with multiwavelength data from radio to TeV $\gamma$-ray observations to improve such birth period estimates. From the ATNF pulsar catalog we expect more than 50 Galactic PWNe to be detectable if the ratio of birth period to current period is <0.5. However, many of them may remain unidentified during evolved stages characterized by low spin-down power and low synchrotron brightness, while only this relic GeV component is visible.},

Since no wide field of view (FoV) observations of the synchrotron emission between radio and X-rays are available, we do not know how the lepton (e+/-) spectra of these two components connect or how the morphology changes with energy. Currently, we find that two distinct lepton spectra describe the respective radio and X-ray/VHE $\gamma$-ray spectra, with a field strength of 5 $\mu$G self-consistently describing a radiation spectral break (or energy maximum) in the multi-TeV domain as observed by H.E.S.S. (if interpreted as IC radiation), while predicting the total hard X-ray flux above 20 keV (measured by the wide FoV INTEGRAL instrument) within a factor of 2. If this same field strength is also representative of the radio structure (including filaments), the implied IC component corresponding to the highest radio frequencies should reveal a relatively bright high-energy $\gamma$-ray structure, and Fermi LAT should be able to resolve it. A higher field strength in the filaments would, however, imply fewer leptons in Vela X and hence a fainter Fermi LAT signal.},

abstract = {The fluxes of the inverse Compton gamma-rays expected from synchrotron X-ray nebulae are calculated and the observability of this radiation is discussed. The main emphasis is given to the pulsar driven nebulae (plerions), although the results and conclusions are equally applicable to the extended non-thermal X-ray sources produced by shock-accelerated electrons in the shell-type supernovae remnants. The existence of the non-thermal (synchrotron) component of X-radiation in these objects implies an effective acceleration of electrons up to energies E_e~100B^1/2_-5epsilon_keV TeV (B_-5=B/10^-5 G; epsilon_ keV=epsilon/1keV). The inverse Compton scattering of the same electrons on the ambient photon fields may result in observable TeV gamma-radiation as well. The 2.7-K microwave background radiation is, as a rule, the dominant target photon field for production of gamma-rays. This provides a direct relation, for the given magnetic field, between the typical energies of the synchrotron (epsilon) and inverse Compton (E) photons produced by the same electrons: epsilon_keV~=0.07(E/1 TeV)B_-5. The ratio of relevant energy fluxes at these energies is about f_ggamma(>=E)/f_x(>=epsilon)~=0.1B^-2_-5xi, where the f_x(>=epsilon) is the energy flux of soft X-rays corrected for absorption, and the factor xi>=1 is introduced in order to take into account possible differences in the source sizes responsible for the fluxes observed by X-ray and gamma-ray detectors. Since the fluxes of X-ray nebulae with angular size less than a few arcmin are typically at the level of f_x<=10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1, then the detectability of these objects in TeV gamma-rays, by current atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes with sensitivities a few times 10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1, would significantly depend on the ambient magnetic field. In particular, the gamma-ray observability of these X-ray nebulae becomes problematic even for the lowest possible magnetic field, i.e. B~B_ISM~=3-5 muG. Otherwise, the detection of gamma-rays from such sources would require xi>>1, which implies that in fact the relativistic electrons occupy a significantly larger region around the accelerator than the >=1 arcmin X-ray nebulae resolved by the ROSAT and ASCA satellites. We argue that the invocation of such an hypothesis allows us to explain satisfactorily the flux of TeV gamma-rays detected from the direction of the recently discovered faint X-ray nebula around the pulsar PSR B1706-44.},

abstract = {We report the detection of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from the young and energetic pulsar PSR B1509 - 58 and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN) in the composite supernova remnant G320.4 - 1.2 (aka MSH 15 - 52). Using 1 yr of survey data with the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT), we detected pulsations from PSR B1509 - 58 up to 1 GeV and extended $\gamma$-ray emission above 1 GeV spatially coincident with the PWN. The pulsar light curve presents two peaks offset from the radio peak by phases 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01 and 0.33 $\pm$ 0.02. New constraining upper limits on the pulsar emission are derived below 1 GeV and confirm a severe spectral break at a few tens of MeV. The nebular spectrum in the 1-100 GeV energy range is well described by a power law with a spectral index of (1.57 $\pm$ 0.17 $\pm$ 0.13) and a flux above 1 GeV of (2.91 $\pm$ 0.79 $\pm$ 1.35) × 10-9 cm-2 s-1. The first errors represent the statistical errors on the fit parameters, while the second ones are the systematic uncertainties. The LAT spectrum of the nebula connects nicely with Cherenkov observations, and indicates a spectral break between GeV and TeV energies.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of $\gamma$-ray pulsations (>=0.1 GeV) from the young radio and X-ray pulsar PSR J0205 + 6449 located in the Galactic supernova remnant 3C 58. Data in the $\gamma$-ray band were acquired by the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly GLAST), while the radio rotational ephemeris used to fold $\gamma$-rays was obtained using both the Green Bank Telescope and the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank. The light curve consists of two peaks separated by 0.49 $\pm$ 0.01 $\pm$ 0.01 cycles which are aligned with the X-ray peaks. The first $\gamma$-ray peak trails the radio pulse by 0.08 $\pm$ 0.01 $\pm$ 0.01, while its amplitude decreases with increasing energy as for the other $\gamma$-ray pulsars. Spectral analysis of the pulsed $\gamma$-ray emission suggests a simple power law of index -2.1 $\pm$ 0.1 $\pm$ 0.2 with an exponential cutoff at 3.0+1.1 -0.7 $\pm$ 0.4 GeV. The first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The integral $\gamma$-ray photon flux above 0.1 GeV is (13.7 $\pm$ 1.4 $\pm$ 3.0) × 10-8 cm-2 s-1, which implies for a distance of 3.2 kpc and assuming a broad fan-like beam a luminosity of 8.3 × 1034 erg s-1 and an efficiency $\eta$ of 0.3%. Finally, we report a 95% upper limit on the flux of 1.7 × 10-8 cm-2 s-1 for off-pulse emission from the object.},

VHE gamma-ray observations of such extended nebulae (with field strengths below ~ 20 micro Gauss) probe the electron component corresponding to the unseen extreme ultraviolet (EUV) synchrotron component, which measures electron injection from earlier evolutionary epochs. VHE observations of PWN therefore introduce a new window on PWN research. This review paper also identifies conditions for maximal VHE visbility of PWN. Regarding pulsar pulsed emission, it is becoming clear that the threshold energies of current telescopes are not sufficient to probe the pulsed gamma-ray component from canonical pulsars. Theoretical estimates of pulsed gamma-ray emission from millisecond pulsars seem to converge and it becomes clear that such detections with current 3rd generation telescopes will not be possible, unless the geometry is favourable.},

These limits are considerably below the infrared flux densities predicted for 3C58 by Reynolds and Chevalier (1984). They are consistent with a break in the spectrum of 3C58 at about 50 GHz, which is two orders of magnitude below the break in the spectrum of the Crab nebula. The change of spectral index across the break for 3C58 is more than 0.5, which implies that the emission from 3C58 is not dominated by a constant injection rate of particles with a power-law distribution. Either the break is intrinsic to the acceleration mechanism at work - presumably from a central neutron star - or it is due to synchrotron losses in the past, with little if any particle injection in recent times.},

Using the IRAC camera, we have imaged the entire source, which results in clear detections of the nebula at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m. The derived flux values are consistent with extrapolation of the X-ray spectrum to the infrared band, demonstrating that any cooling break in the synchrotron spectrum must occur near the soft X-ray band. We also detect the torus surrounding PSR J0205+6449, the 65 ms pulsar that powers 3C 58. The torus spectrum requires a break between the infrared and X-ray bands, and perhaps multiple breaks. This complex spectrum, which is an imprint of the particles injected into the nebula, has considerable consequences for the evolution of the broadband spectrum of 3C 58. We illustrate these effects and discuss the impact of these observations on the modeling of broadband spectra of pulsar wind nebulae.},

abstract = {3C 58 is a young Crab-like supernova remnant. Historical evidence strongly suggests an association of the remnant with supernova SN 1181, which would make 3C 58 younger than the Crab Nebula. Recent Chandra observations have identified the young 65 ms pulsar J0205+6449 at its center, embedded in a compact nebula that, as we show here, appears to be confined by the pulsar wind termination shock. We present new Chandra observations of this compact nebula and the embedded pulsar that set strong upper limits on the thermal emission originating from the neutron star surface. These limits fall far below predictions of standard neutron star cooling, requiring the presence of exotic cooling processes in the neutron star core.},

abstract = {We present an investigation of the spectral and spatial structure of the X-ray emission from 3C 58 based on a 350 ks observation with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. This deep image, obtained as part of the Chandra Large Project program, reveals new information on nearly all spatial scales in the pulsar wind nebula (PWN). On the smallest scales, we derive an improved limit of T<1.02×106 K for blackbody emission from the entire surface of the central neutron star (NS), confirming the need for rapid, nonstandard cooling in the stellar interior. Furthermore, we show that the data are consistent with emission from a light-element atmosphere with a similar temperature. Surrounding the NS, a toroidal structure with a jet is resolved, consistent with earlier measurements and indicative of an east-west orientation for the projected rotation axis of the pulsar. A complex of looplike X-ray filaments fills the nebula interior and corresponds well with structures seen in the radio band. Several of the structures coincide with optical filaments as well. The emission from the interior of the PWN, including the pulsar, jet, and filaments, is primarily nonthermal in nature. The power-law index steepens with radius, but appears to also show small azimuthal variations. The outermost regions of the nebula require a thermal emission component, confirming the presence of an ejecta-rich swept up shell.},

Data were obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, the Jodrell Bank Observatory, and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. We present phase-coherent timing analyses showing timing noise and two spin-up glitches with fractional frequency increases of ~3.4 × 10-7 near MJD 52555 and ~3.8 × 10-6 between MJDs 52777 and 53062. These glitches are unusually large if the pulsar was created in the historical supernova in 1181, as has been suggested. For the X-ray timing, we developed a new unbinned maximum likelihood method for determining pulse arrival times, which performs significantly better than the traditional binned techniques. In addition, we present an X-ray pulse profile analysis of four years of RXTE data showing that the pulsar is detected up to ~40 keV. We also present the first measurement of the phase offset between the radio and X-ray pulse for this source, showing that the radio pulse leads the X-ray pulse by phi = 0.10 $\pm$ 0.01 in phase. We compile all known measurements of the phase offsets between radio and X-ray and radio and $\gamma$-ray pulses for X-ray and $\gamma$-ray pulsars. We show that there is no relationship between pulse period and phase offset, supported by our measurement of the phase offset for PSR J0205+6449.},

abstract = {The dramatic increase in the number of known gamma-ray pulsars since the launch of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly GLAST) offers the first opportunity to study a sizable population of these high-energy objects. This catalog summarizes 46 high-confidence pulsed detections using the first six months of data taken by the Large Area Telescope (LAT), Fermi's main instrument. Sixteen previously unknown pulsars were discovered by searching for pulsed signals at the positions of bright gamma-ray sources seen with the LAT, or at the positions of objects suspected to be neutron stars based on observations at other wavelengths. The dimmest observed flux among these gamma-ray-selected pulsars is 6.0 × 10-8 ph cm-2 s-1 (for E>100 MeV). Pulsed gamma-ray emission was discovered from 24 known pulsars by using ephemerides (timing solutions) derived from monitoring radio pulsars. Eight of these new gamma-ray pulsars are millisecond pulsars. The dimmest observed flux among the radio-selected pulsars is 1.4 × 10-8 ph cm-2 s-1 (for E>100 MeV). The remaining six gamma-ray pulsars were known since the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory mission, or before. The limiting flux for pulse detection is non-uniform over the sky owing to different background levels, especially near the Galactic plane. The pulsed energy spectra can be described by a power law with an exponential cutoff, with cutoff energies in the range ~1-5 GeV. The rotational energy-loss rate ({\.E}) of these neutron stars spans five decades, from ~3 × 1033 erg s-1 to 5 × 1038 erg s-1, and the apparent efficiencies for conversion to gamma-ray emission range from ~0.1% to ~ unity, although distance uncertainties complicate efficiency estimates. The pulse shapes show substantial diversity, but roughly 75% of the gamma-ray pulse profiles have two peaks, separated by gsim0.2 of rotational phase. For most of the pulsars, gamma-ray emission appears to come mainly from the outer magnetosphere, while polar-cap emission remains plausible for a remaining few. Spatial associations imply that many of these pulsars power pulsar wind nebulae. Finally, these discoveries suggest that gamma-ray-selected young pulsars are born at a rate comparable to that of their radio-selected cousins and that the birthrate of all young gamma-ray-detected pulsars is a substantial fraction of the expected Galactic supernova rate.},

We interpret these pulsations as corresponding to a young rotation-powered pulsar, PSR J0205+6449, that is associated with and powers SNR 3C 58. Analysis of archival Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data from 3 years earlier confirms these pulsations and allows us to determine a spin-down rate of P=1.93×10-13ss-1. Assuming a magnetic dipole model for PSR J0205+6449, we infer a surface magnetic field of 3.6×1012 G. The historical age for the pulsar (based on its identification with SN 1181) is 820 yr. Taken with the observed period and spin-down rate, we derive an initial spin period of ~60 ms.},

abstract = {We study the spectral evolution of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) taking into account the energy injected when they are young. We model the evolution of the magnetic field inside a uniformly expanding PWN. Considering time-dependent injection from the pulsar and coolings by radiative and adiabatic losses, we solve the evolution of the particle distribution function. The model is calibrated by fitting the calculated spectrum to the observations of the Crab Nebula at an age of a thousand years. The spectral evolution of the Crab Nebula in our model shows that the flux ratio of TeV $\gamma$-rays to X-rays increases with time, which implies that old PWNe are faint in X-rays, but not in TeV $\gamma$-rays. The increase of this ratio is because the magnetic field decreases with time and is not because the X-ray emitting particles are cooled more rapidly than the TeV $\gamma$-ray emitting particles. Our spectral evolution model matches the observed rate of the radio flux decrease of the Crab Nebula. This result implies that our magnetic field evolution model is close to the reality. Finally, from the viewpoint of the spectral evolution, only a small fraction of the injected energy from the Crab Pulsar needs to go to the magnetic field, which is consistent with previous studies.},

abstract = {We present a catalog of high-energy gamma-ray sources detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT), the primary science instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi), during the first 11 months of the science phase of the mission, which began on 2008 August 4. The First Fermi-LAT catalog (1FGL) contains 1451 sources detected and characterized in the 100 MeV to 100 GeV range. Source detection was based on the average flux over the 11 month period, and the threshold likelihood Test Statistic is 25, corresponding to a significance of just over 4$\sigma$. The 1FGL catalog includes source location regions, defined in terms of elliptical fits to the 95% confidence regions and power-law spectral fits as well as flux measurements in five energy bands for each source. In addition, monthly light curves are provided. Using a protocol defined before launch we have tested for several populations of gamma-ray sources among the sources in the catalog. For individual LAT-detected sources we provide firm identifications or plausible associations with sources in other astronomical catalogs. Identifications are based on correlated variability with counterparts at other wavelengths, or on spin or orbital periodicity. For the catalogs and association criteria that we have selected, 630 of the sources are unassociated. Care was taken to characterize the sensitivity of the results to the model of interstellar diffuse gamma-ray emission used to model the bright foreground, with the result that 161 sources at low Galactic latitudes and toward bright local interstellar clouds are flagged as having properties that are strongly dependent on the model or as potentially being due to incorrectly modeled structure in the Galactic diffuse emission.},

abstract = {Geminga is the second brightest persistent source in the GeV gamma-ray sky. Discovered in 1975 by SAS-2 mission, it was identified as a pulsar only in the 90s, when ROSAT detected the 237 ms X-ray periodicity, that was later also found by EGRET in gamma rays. Even though Geminga has been one of the most intensively studied isolated neutron star during the last 30 years, its interest remains intact especially at gamma-ray energies, where instruments like the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi mission will provide an unprecedented view of this pulsars. We will report on the preliminary results obtained on the analysis of the first year of observations. We have been able to do precise timing of Geminga using solely gamma rays, producing a timing solution and allowing a deep study of the evolution of the light curve with energy. We have also measured and studied the high-energy cutoff in the phase-averaged spectrum and produced a detailed study of the spectral evolution with phase.},

abstract = {We report on the Fermi-LAT observations of the Geminga pulsar, the second brightest non-variable GeV source in the $\gamma$-ray sky and the first example of a radio-quiet $\gamma$-ray pulsar. The observations cover one year, from the launch of the Fermi satellite through 2009 June 15. A data sample of over 60,000 photons enabled us to build a timing solution based solely on $\gamma$-rays. Timing analysis shows two prominent peaks, separated by $\Delta$phi = 0.497 $\pm$ 0.004 in phase, which narrow with increasing energy. Pulsed $\gamma$-rays are observed beyond 18 GeV, precluding emission below 2.7 stellar radii because of magnetic absorption. The phase-averaged spectrum was fitted with a power law with exponential cutoff of spectral index $\Gamma$ = (1.30 $\pm$ 0.01 $\pm$ 0.04), cutoff energy E 0 = (2.46 $\pm$ 0.04 $\pm$ 0.17) GeV, and an integral photon flux above 0.1 GeV of (4.14 $\pm$ 0.02 $\pm$ 0.32) × 10--6 cm--2 s--1. The first uncertainties are statistical and the second ones are systematic. The phase-resolved spectroscopy shows a clear evolution of the spectral parameters, with the spectral index reaching a minimum value just before the leading peak and the cutoff energy having maxima around the peaks. The phase-resolved spectroscopy reveals that pulsar emission is present at all rotational phases. The spectral shape, broad pulse profile, and maximum photon energy favor the outer magnetospheric emission scenarios.},

abstract = {Previous observations of the middle-aged pulsar Geminga with XMM-Newton and Chandra have shown an unusual pulsar wind nebula (PWN), with a 20'' long central (axial) tail directed opposite to the pulsar's proper motion and two 2' long, bent lateral (outer) tails. Here, we report on a deeper Chandra observation (78 ks exposure) and a few additional XMM-Newton observations of the Geminga PWN. The new Chandra observation has shown that the axial tail, which includes up to three brighter blobs, extends at least 50'' (i.e., 0.06d 250 pc) from the pulsar (d 250 is the distance scaled to 250 pc). It also allowed us to image the patchy outer tails and the emission in the immediate vicinity of the pulsar with high resolution. The PWN luminosity, L 0.3-8 keV ~ 3 × 1029 d 2 250 erg s-1, is lower than the pulsar's magnetospheric luminosity by a factor of 10. The spectra of the PWN elements are rather hard (photon index $\Gamma$ ~ 1). Comparing the two Chandra images, we found evidence of PWN variability, including possible motion of the blobs along the axial tail. The X-ray PWN is the synchrotron radiation from relativistic particles of the pulsar wind (PW); its morphology is connected with the supersonic motion of Geminga. We speculate that the outer tails are either a sky projection of the limb-brightened boundary of a shell formed in the region of contact discontinuity, where the wind bulk flow is decelerated by shear instability, or polar outflows from the pulsar bent by the ram pressure from the interstellar medium. In the former case, the axial tail may be a jet emanating along the pulsar's spin axis, perhaps aligned with the direction of motion. In the latter case, the axial tail may be the shocked PW collimated by ram pressure.},

Although there are more than 1800 known radio pulsars, until recently only seven were observed to pulse in gamma rays, and these were all discovered at other wavelengths. The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) makes it possible to pinpoint neutron stars through their gamma-ray pulsations. We report the detection of 16 gamma-ray pulsars in blind frequency searches using the LAT. Most of these pulsars are coincident with previously unidentified gamma-ray sources, and many are associated with supernova remnants. Direct detection of gamma-ray pulsars enables studies of emission mechanisms, population statistics, and the energetics of pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the gamma-ray measurements by the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in the region of the supernova remnant (SNR) Cygnus Loop (G74.0-8.5). We detect significant gamma-ray emission associated with the SNR in the energy band 0.2-100 GeV. The gamma-ray spectrum shows a break in the range 2-3 GeV. The gamma-ray luminosity is ~1 × 1033 erg s-1 between 1 and 100 GeV, much lower than those of other GeV-emitting SNRs. The morphology is best represented by a ring shape, with inner/outer radii 0fdg7 $\pm$ 0fdg1 and 1fdg6 $\pm$ 0fdg1. Given the association among X-ray rims, H$\alpha$ filaments, and gamma-ray emission, we argue that gamma rays originate in interactions between particles accelerated in the SNR and interstellar gas or radiation fields adjacent to the shock regions. The decay of neutral pions produced in nucleon-nucleon interactions between accelerated hadrons and interstellar gas provides a reasonable explanation for the gamma-ray spectrum.},

abstract = {We report the current status of the observations of supernova remnants (SNRs) with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, focusing on middle-aged SNRs that appear to be interacting with molecular clouds. Observations with the Fermi LAT in an energy range from 0.2 to ~100 GeV have unveiled the presence of luminous GeV gamma-ray emission in middle-aged SNRs, providing a new insight into the shock-acceleration theory and the origin of galactic cosmic rays. The middle-aged SNRs detected by the Fermi LAT are generally much brighter in GeV than in TeV in terms of energy flux, which emphasizes the importance of the GeV observations. Spectral steepening in the Fermi-LAT band is commonly found for the GeV-luminous SNRs. Remarkably, most (if not all) of them are known to be interacting with molecular clouds, and they are also the strong sources of synchrotron radio emission. We discuss possible scenarios to explain the enhanced GeV gamma-ray emission in the cloud-interacting SNRs. Particular emphasis is placed on a scenario in which shock-accelerated cosmic-rays are adiabatically compressed and energized as result of radiative cooling behind the cloud shock.},

abstract = {We apply the non-linear diffusive shock acceleration theory in order to describe the properties of SN 1572 (G120.1+1.4, hereafter simply Tycho). By analyzing its multi-wavelength spectrum, we show how Tycho's forward shock is accelerating protons up to ~500 TeV, channelling into cosmic rays more than 10% of its kinetic energy. Our model allows us to take into account self-consistently the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles, the generation of magnetic fields in the shock proximity and the dynamical reaction of the magnetic field as well. We find that the streaming instability induced by cosmic rays is consistent with all the observational evidences indicating a very efficient magnetic field amplification (up to ~300 uG, in particular the radio and X-ray morphology of the remnant. In such a strong magnetic field, the velocity of the scattering centers in the upstream may be enhanced and make accelerated particles feel an effective compression factor lower than 4, in turn leading to an energy spectrum steeper than the standard prediction $\propto E^{-2}$. Accounting for this important piece of information, we explain the gamma-ray spectrum from the GeV up to the TeV band, recently measured respectively by Fermi-LAT and VERITAS, as due to pion decay produced in nuclear collisions by accelerated nuclei scattering against the background gas. We also work out the details of the non-thermal emission due to the accelerated electrons, building up a model simultaneously consistent with Tycho's inferred hydrodynamics, morphology and radio to gamma-ray photon spectrum.},

During the first years of the mission, the LAT team has gained considerable insight into the in-flight performance of the instrument. Accordingly, we have updated the analysis used to reduce LAT data for public release as well as the instrument response functions (IRFs), the description of the instrument performance provided for data analysis. In this paper, we describe the effects that motivated these updates. Furthermore, we discuss how we originally derived IRFs from Monte Carlo simulations and later corrected those IRFs for discrepancies observed between flight and simulated data. We also give details of the validations performed using flight data and quantify the residual uncertainties in the IRFs. Finally, we describe techniques the LAT team has developed to propagate those uncertainties into estimates of the systematic errors on common measurements such as fluxes and spectra of astrophysical sources.},

abstract = {HESS J1858+020 is a TeV gamma-ray source that was reported to have no clearly catalogued counterpart at any wavelength. However, it has been recently proposed that this source is indirectly associated with the radio source, re-identified as a supernova remnant (SNR), G35.6-0.4. The latter has been found to be middle-aged (˜30 kyr) and to have nearby molecular clouds (MCs). HESS J1858+020 was proposed to be the result of the interaction of protons accelerated in the SNR shell with target ions residing in the clouds. The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) First Source Catalog does not list any source coincident with the position of HESS J1858+020, but some lie close. Here, we analyse more than 2 years of data obtained with the Fermi-LAT for the region of interest, and consider whether it is indeed possible that the closest LAT source, 1FGL J1857.1+0212c, is related to HESS J1858+020. We conclude it is not, and we impose upper limits on the GeV emission originating from HESS J1858+020. Using a simplified 3D model for the cosmic ray propagation out from the shell of the SNR, we consider whether the interaction between SNR G35.6-0.4 and the MCs nearby could give rise to the TeV emission of HESS J1858+020 without producing a GeV counterpart. If so, the pair of SNR/TeV source with no GeV detection would be reminiscent of other similarly aged SNRs, such as some of the TeV hotspots near W28, for which cosmic ray diffusion may be used to explain their multifrequency phenomenology. However, for HESS J1858+020, we found that although the phase space in principle allows such a GeV-TeV non-correlation to appear, usual and/or observationally constrained values of the parameters (e.g., diffusion coefficients and cloud-SNR likely distances) would disfavour it.},

A bright unresolved gamma-ray source detected at a significance of 38$\sigma$ is found to coincide with SNR W49B. The energy spectrum in the 0.2-200 GeV range gradually steepens toward high energies. The luminosity is estimated to be 1.5 × 1036 (D/8 kpc)2 erg s-1 in this energy range. There is no indication that the gamma-ray emission comes from a pulsar. Assuming that the supernova remnant (SNR) shell is the site of gamma-ray production, the observed spectrum can be explained either by the decay of neutral $\pi$ mesons produced through the proton-proton collisions or by electron bremsstrahlung. The calculated energy density of relativistic particles responsible for the LAT flux is estimated to be remarkably large, U e,p >104 eV cm-3, for either gamma-ray production mechanism.},

abstract = {We present detailed analysis of two gamma-ray sources, 1FGL J1801.3-2322c and 1FGL J1800.5-2359c, that have been found toward the supernova remnant (SNR) W28 with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. 1FGL J1801.3-2322c is found to be an extended source within the boundary of SNR W28, and to extensively overlap with the TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1801-233, which is associated with a dense molecular cloud interacting with the SNR. The gamma-ray spectrum measured with the LAT from 0.2 to 100 GeV can be described by a broken power-law function with a break at ~1 GeV and photon indices of 2.09 $\pm$ 0.08 (stat) $\pm$ 0.28 (sys) below the break and 2.74 $\pm$ 0.06 (stat) $\pm$ 0.09 (sys) above the break. Given the clear association between HESS J1801-233 and the shocked molecular cloud and a smoothly connected spectrum in the GeV-TeV band, we consider the origin of the gamma-ray emission in both GeV and TeV ranges to be the interaction between particles accelerated in the SNR and the molecular cloud. The decay of neutral pions produced in interactions between accelerated hadrons and dense molecular gas provides a reasonable explanation for the broadband gamma-ray spectrum. 1FGL J1800.5-2359c, located outside the southern boundary of SNR W28, cannot be resolved. An upper limit on the size of the gamma-ray emission was estimated to be ~16' using events above ~2 GeV under the assumption of a circular shape with uniform surface brightness. It appears to coincide with the TeV source HESS J1800-240B, which is considered to be associated with a dense molecular cloud that contains the ultra compact H II region W28A2 (G5.89-0.39). We found no significant gamma-ray emission in the LAT energy band at the positions of TeV sources HESS J1800-230A and HESS J1800-230C. The LAT data for HESS J1800-230A combined with the TeV data points indicate a spectral break between 10 GeV and 100 GeV.},

abstract = {Recent observations of supernova remnants (SNRs) hint that they accelerate cosmic rays to energies close to ~1015 electron volts. However, the nature of the particles that produce the emission remains ambiguous. We report observations of SNR W44 with the Fermi Large Area Telescope at energies between 2 × 108 electron volts and 3 ×1011 electron volts. The detection of a source with a morphology corresponding to the SNR shell implies that the emission is produced by particles accelerated there. The gamma-ray spectrum is well modeled with emission from protons and nuclei. Its steepening above ~109 electron volts provides a probe with which to study how particle acceleration responds to environmental effects such as shock propagation in dense clouds and how accelerated particles are released into interstellar space.},

abstract = {We report on the first detection of GeV high-energy gamma-ray emission from a young supernova remnant (SNR) with the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. These observations reveal a source with no discernible spatial extension detected at a significance level of 12.2$\sigma$ above 500 MeV at a location that is consistent with the position of the remnant of the supernova explosion that occurred around 1680 in the Cassiopeia constellation---Cassiopeia A (Cas A). The gamma-ray flux and spectral shape of the source are consistent with a scenario in which the gamma-ray emission originates from relativistic particles accelerated in the shell of this remnant. The total content of cosmic rays (electrons and protons) accelerated in Cas A can be estimated as W CR ~= (1-4) × 1049 erg thanks to the well-known density in the remnant assuming that the observed gamma ray originates in the SNR shell(s). The magnetic field in the radio-emitting plasma can be robustly constrained as B >= 0.1 mG, providing new evidence of the magnetic field amplification at the forward shock and the strong field in the shocked ejecta.},

G296.1-0.5 is a bright remnant that displays an incomplete multiple-shell morphology in both its radio and X-ray images. We use a set of observations toward G296.1-0.5, from three distinct pointings of EPIC, in order to perform a thorough spatial and spectral analysis of this remnant, and hence determine what type of progenitor gave rise to the supernova explosion, and describe the evolutionary state of the SNR. Our XMM-Newton observations establish that the spectral characteristics are consistent across the X-ray bright regions of the object and are best described by a model of the emission from a nonequilibrium ionization collisional plasma. The study reveals that the emission from the shell is characterized by an excess of N and an underabundance of O, which is typical of wind material from red supergiant and Wolf-Rayet stars. Additionally, we have detected transient X-ray source 2XMMi J115004.8-622442 at the edge of the SNR whose properties suggest that it is the result of stellar flare, and we discuss its nature in more detail.},

We model the SNR by coupling the hydrodynamic evolution with nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and track self-consistently the ionization state of the shock-heated plasma. Using a plasma emissivity code and the results of the model, we predict the thermal X-ray emission and combine it with the non-thermal component in order to obtain the complete spectrum in this energy range. Hence, we study how the interpretation of thermal X-ray observations is affected by the efficiency of the DSA process, and find that, compared to test particle cases, the efficient DSA example yields a smaller shock radius and speed, a larger compression ratio, and lower intensity X-ray thermal emission. We also find that a model where the shock is not assumed to produce CRs can fit the X-ray observational properties of an example with efficient particle acceleration, with a different set of input parameters, and in particular a much lower explosion energy. Additionally, we model the broadband non-thermal emission and investigate what signatures result from the acceleration of particles.},

abstract = {It is shown that the radio and gamma-ray emission observed from newly found "GeV-bright" supernova remnants (SNRs) can be explained by a model in which a shocked cloud and shock-accelerated cosmic rays (CRs) frozen in it are simultaneously compressed by the supernova blast wave as a result of formation of a radiative cloud shock. Simple reacceleration of pre-existing CRs is generally sufficient to power the observed gamma-ray emission through the decays of $\pi$0-mesons produced in hadronic interactions between high-energy protons (nuclei) and gas in the compressed-cloud layer. This model provides a natural account of the observed synchrotron radiation in SNRs W51C, W44, and IC 443 with flat radio spectral index, which can be ascribed to a combination of secondary and reaccelerated electrons and positrons.},

annote = {-general SNR analysis stuff:
	-how do my results compare to other wavelengths?
	-What is overall luminosity given some distance
	-does it fit better with acceleration of nuclear cosmic rays at SN shocks, or shock cloud interaction, or both?
	-hadronic (pion decay), or leptonic (IC,bremms)
	-prodcut of avg gas density in the region and total energy content of the accelrated particles (protons specifically?) give energy density, which is relevant why?
	-electron density contraints from radio and x-ray can be examined to determine whether the signal can really be from IC.
	-cosmic rays accelerated in expanding shocks of SNR (DSA?)
	-Efficiency: How much of the SN explosion kinetic energy goes into energy of relativistc protons and neutrons? ** Not confirmed observationally yet!
	-Enchanced pion decay emission from SNR interacting with molec clouds
<i>	-How molec cloud interaction gives direct evidence of acceleration of nuclear component of cosmic rays
	-MeV/GeV crucial in indentifying nuclear cosmic rays due to pi bump at 70MeV
	-Egret found gamma ray sources near bright radio SNR, but poor localization means it couldn't confirm (hard to separate out pulsar component?)
</i>	-In my work, be able to overlay radio, x-ray, and any other waveband maps (HII for example)
	-Show not just radio map contours but outer boundary edge? Same difference maybe, depends what else I want to overlay
	-Compare fit with radio map to say something about sub-structure
	-to demonstrate how extended use slices where you compare with PS
	-slices also good to show asymmetry of source in slice direction
	-Do I see structure more than PL in SED? Combine my {\&}gt;10gev and {\&}lt;10gev SED points, turn off SED
	-consider effects of diffuse uncertainty by changing the normalization of the galactic diffuse?
	-systematic error of estimated flux by not knowing true gamma ray morphology (we use disk/gauss/etc rather than what actual shape is)
	-The expanding shock waves driven by the supernova explosion are expected to be the sites of the acceleration of multi-GeV particles.
	-To start talking about what's going on physically can try to determine underlying partcle population (say broken PL), need to know radio synch index?
	-Assume particles distributed uniformly in the volume of the rem (V=4/3 pi R^3) need to determine effecive radius given angular size and distance
	-age an radius can give expansion velocity
	-E_SN / n_0 == kinetic energy of explosion / interstellar density which main blast wave expands into
	-X-ray data can give n_0
	-radio data can give clumpyness (or lack thereof) of emission
	-total atomic and molec H mass
             M_h= n_H * m_p * V 
	-If gamma rays are attributed to molec clouds, why emission througout rem unless molec clouds surround the rem?
	-whatever models I use need to match both in MeV/GeV and at low E
	-How to get E in protons/electrons?
	-Does gamCyg spectrum have any breaks?
	-Do all LAT rems have spectral breaks?
	-Protons up to 200TeV from DSA, so why shocks? Escape? MHD turb?
	-For smaller rems, can emission possibly be explained by PWN emission. Consider size of PWN (if young too small neb), and radio emission

-W51 (G49.2 −0.7)stuff:
	-23sigma even in 3 month bright source list
	-no Egret counterpart
	-First LAT detected SNR
	-6kpc,3 3e4yrs
	-thermal xrays
	-known shocked atomic and molec gas so we know there's molec cloud interaction
	-HESS TeV, possible Milagro 
	-They use 2-10Gev band to show extent of SNR
	-gaussian ext =0.22deg
	-two say that it's ext and  not a superposition of PS, they place a PS at 60 diff postions inside the rem and compare that like two just having uniform surface brightness. Maybe this is unnecessary for me since I use pointlike, put a point source in and then find max like. if there's a PS it wil have a signif TS
	-They take HESS integral flux and convert to diff flux at 1TeV assuming and index
	-W51 is pointlike below 1gev!!! Is this similar/true for gamma Cygni? is that why I've been having issues with its TS at low energies (totally likely since PSF is so broad at low energies), this is why it's necessary to know what's going on at higher energies to determine the morphology
	-uniform surface brightness inside remnant means disk (or ellip disk)
	-The large luminosity of the LAT source can be explained naturally by a large number of accelerated protons and dense environments as expected for the case of W51C.
	-why is B different for the differenty emission components? because they occur at different locations? OH that's what would be needed of those params to reproduce the LAT/radio results
	-unlikely to be PWN which would have few pc extent and much weaker radio emission compared with shell
	-<i>Fermi</i> has discerned accelerated ions in a middle-aged remnant that is interacting with dense clouds.

	-Electron--ion and electron--electron bremsstrahlung spectra are computed as in Baring et al. (1999)
	-What's up with "The break feature in the proton spectrum, which is introduced on phenomenological grounds, is not expected in a shock acceleration zone if acceleration proceeds close to the Bohm limit (e.g., Baring et al. 1999)"
	I think it means DSA works without any breaks, maybe break is due to MHD turbulence? due to ion-neutral collisions?
	Or perhaps energy dependent escape of accelerated particles from the remnant can account for the steepening proton spectrum?

abstract = {The discovery of bright gamma-ray emission coincident with supernova remnant (SNR) W51C is reported using the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. W51C is a middle-aged remnant (~104 yr) with intense radio synchrotron emission in its shell and known to be interacting with a molecular cloud. The gamma-ray emission is spatially extended, broadly consistent with the radio and X-ray extent of SNR W51C. The energy spectrum in the 0.2-50 GeV band exhibits steepening toward high energies. The luminosity is greater than 1 × 1036 erg s-1 given the distance constraint of D > 5.5 kpc, which makes this object one of the most luminous gamma-ray sources in our Galaxy. The observed gamma-rays can be explained reasonably by a combination of efficient acceleration of nuclear cosmic rays at supernova shocks and shock-cloud interactions. The decay of neutral $\pi$ mesons produced in hadronic collisions provides a plausible explanation for the gamma-ray emission. The product of the average gas density and the total energy content of the accelerated protons amounts to \bar{n}_HW_p ≃ 5× 10^{51} (D/6 kpc)^2 erg cm^{-3}. Electron density constraints from the radio and X-ray bands render it difficult to explain the LAT signal as due to inverse Compton scattering. The Fermi LAT source coincident with SNR W51C sheds new light on the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.},

abstract = {We report observation of the supernova remnant (SNR) IC 443 (G189.1+3.0) with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the energy band between 200 MeV and 50 GeV. IC 443 is a shell-type SNR with mixed morphology located off the outer Galactic plane where high-energy emission has been detected in the X-ray, GeV and TeV gamma-ray bands. Past observations suggest IC 443 has been interacting with surrounding interstellar matter. Proximity between dense shocked molecular clouds and GeV-TeV gamma-ray emission regions detected by EGRET, MAGIC, and VERITAS suggests an interpretation that cosmic-ray (CR) particles are accelerated by the SNR. With the high gamma-ray statistics and broad energy coverage provided by the LAT, we accurately characterize the gamma-ray emission produced by the CRs accelerated at IC 443. The emission region is extended in the energy band with $\theta$68 = 0fdg27 $\pm$ 0fdg01(stat) $\pm$ 0fdg03(sys) for an assumed two-dimensional Gaussian profile and overlaps almost completely with the extended source region of VERITAS. Its centroid is displaced significantly from the known pulsar wind nebula (PWN) which suggests the PWN is not the major contributor in the present energy band. The observed spectrum changes its power-law slope continuously and continues smoothly to the MAGIC and VERITAS data points. The combined gamma-ray spectrum (200 MeV <E< 2 TeV) is reproduced well by decays of neutral pions produced by a broken power-law proton spectrum with a break around 70 GeV.},

abstract = {The $\gamma$-ray sky >100 MeV is dominated by the diffuse emissions from interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar gas and radiation fields of the Milky Way. Observations of these diffuse emissions provide a tool to study cosmic-ray origin and propagation, and the interstellar medium. We present measurements from the first 21 months of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) mission and compare with models of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission generated using the GALPROP code. The models are fitted to cosmic-ray data and incorporate astrophysical input for the distribution of cosmic-ray sources, interstellar gas, and radiation fields. To assess uncertainties associated with the astrophysical input, a grid of models is created by varying within observational limits the distribution of cosmic-ray sources, the size of the cosmic-ray confinement volume (halo), and the distribution of interstellar gas. An all-sky maximum-likelihood fit is used to determine the X CO factor, the ratio between integrated CO-line intensity and H2 column density, the fluxes and spectra of the $\gamma$-ray point sources from the first Fermi-LAT catalog, and the intensity and spectrum of the isotropic background including residual cosmic rays that were misclassified as $\gamma$-rays, all of which have some dependency on the assumed diffuse emission model. The models are compared on the basis of their maximum-likelihood ratios as well as spectra, longitude, and latitude profiles. We also provide residual maps for the data following subtraction of the diffuse emission models. The models are consistent with the data at high and intermediate latitudes but underpredict the data in the inner Galaxy for energies above a few GeV. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed, including the contribution by undetected point-source populations and spectral variations of cosmic rays throughout the Galaxy. In the outer Galaxy, we find that the data prefer models with a flatter distribution of cosmic-ray sources, a larger cosmic-ray halo, or greater gas density than is usually assumed. Our results in the outer Galaxy are consistent with other Fermi-LAT studies of this region that used different analysis methods than employed in this paper.},

abstract = {We present observations of the young supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). We clearly detect a source positionally coincident with the SNR. The source is extended with a best-fit extension of 0fdg55 $\pm$ 0fdg04 matching the size of the non-thermal X-ray and TeV gamma-ray emission from the remnant. The positional coincidence and the matching extended emission allow us to identify the LAT source with SNR RX J1713.7-3946. The spectrum of the source can be described by a very hard power law with a photon index of $\Gamma$ = 1.5 $\pm$ 0.1 that coincides in normalization with the steeper H.E.S.S.-detected gamma-ray spectrum at higher energies. The broadband gamma-ray emission is consistent with a leptonic origin as the dominant mechanism for the gamma-ray emission.},

abstract = {We report on gamma-ray observations of the supernova remnant (SNR) RX J0852.0-4622 with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. In the Fermi-LAT data, we find a spatially extended source at the location of the SNR. The extension is consistent with the SNR size seen in other wavelengths such as X-rays and TeV gamma rays, leading to the identification of the gamma-ray source with the SNR. The spectrum is well described as a power law with a photon index of $\Gamma$ = 1.85 $\pm$ 0.06 (stat)+0.18 - 0.19 (sys), which smoothly connects to the H.E.S.S. spectrum in the TeV energy band. We discuss the gamma-ray emission mechanism based on multiwavelength data. The broadband data can be fit well by a model in which the gamma rays are of hadronic origin. We also consider a scenario with inverse Compton scattering of electrons as the emission mechanism of the gamma rays. Although the leptonic model predicts a harder spectrum in the Fermi-LAT energy range, the model can fit the data considering the statistical and systematic errors.},

abstract = {One of the main results of the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope is the discovery of {\gamma}-ray selected pulsars. The high magnetic field pulsar, PSR J0007+7303 in CTA1, was the first ever to be discovered through its {\gamma}-ray pulsations. Based on analysis of 2 years of LAT survey data, we report on the discovery of {\gamma}-ray emission in the off-pulse phase interval at the ~ 6{\sigma} level. The flux from this emission in the energy range E \geq 100 MeV is F_100 = (1.73\pm0.40)\times10^(-8) photons/cm^2/s and is best fitted by a power law with a photon index of {\Gamma} = 2.54\pm0.14. The pulsed {\gamma}-ray flux in the same energy range is F_100 = (3.95\pm0.07)\times10^(-7) photons/cm^2/s and is best fitted by an exponentially-cutoff power-law spectrum with a photon index of {\Gamma} = 1.41 \pm 0.23 and a cutoff energy E_c = 4.04 \pm 0.20 GeV. We find no flux variability neither at the 2009 May glitch nor in the long term behavior. We model the {\gamma}-ray light curve with two high-altitude emission models, the outer gap and slot gap, and find that the model that best fits the data depends strongly on the assumed origin of the off-pulse emission. Both models favor a large angle between the magnetic axis and observer line of sight, consistent with the nondetection of radio emission being a geometrical effect. Finally we discuss how the LAT results bear on the understanding of the cooling of this neutron star.},

abstract = {We present multiwavelength studies of the 106.6 ms $\gamma$-ray pulsar PSR J1907+06 near the TeV source MGRO J1908+06. Timing observations with Fermi result in a precise position determination for the pulsar of R.A. = 19h07m54.s7(2), decl. = +06$\,^{\circ}$02'16(2)'' placing the pulsar firmly within the TeV source extent, suggesting the TeV source is the pulsar wind nebula of PSR J1907+0602. Pulsed $\gamma$-ray emission is clearly visible at energies from 100 MeV to above 10 GeV. The phase-averaged power-law index in the energy range E > 0.1 GeV is $\Gamma$ = 1.76 $\pm$ 0.05 with an exponential cutoff energy Ec = 3.6 $\pm$ 0.5 GeV. We present the energy-dependent $\gamma$-ray pulsed light curve as well as limits on off-pulse emission associated with the TeV source. We also report the detection of very faint (flux density of ~= 3.4 $\mu$Jy) radio pulsations with the Arecibo telescope at 1.5 GHz having a dispersion measure DM = 82.1 $\pm$ 1.1 cm-3 pc. This indicates a distance of 3.2 $\pm$ 0.6 kpc and a pseudo-luminosity of L 1400 ~= 0.035 mJy kpc2. A Chandra ACIS observation revealed an absorbed, possibly extended, compact (lsim4'') X-ray source with significant nonthermal emission at R.A. = 19h07m54.s76, decl. = +06$\,^{\circ}$02'14farcs6 with a flux of 2.3+0.6 -1.4 × 10-14 erg cm-2 s-1. From archival ASCA observations, we place upper limits on any arcminute scale 2-10 keV X-ray emission of ~1 × 10-13 erg cm-2 s-1. The implied distance to the pulsar is compatible with that of the supernova remnant G40.5 - 0.5, located on the far side of the TeV nebula from PSR J1907+0602, and the S74 molecular cloud on the nearer side which we discuss as potential birth sites.},

abstract = {Galactic cosmic rays are believed to be accelerated at supernova remnants via diffusive shock acceleration. Though this mechanism gives fairly robust predictions for the spectrum of particles accelerated at the shock, the spectrum of the cosmic rays which are eventually injected in the interstellar medium is more uncertain and depends on the details of the process of particle escape from the shock. Knowing the spectral shape of these escaping particles is of crucial importance in order to assess the validity of the supernova remnant paradigm for cosmic ray origin. Moreover, after escaping from a supernova remnant, cosmic rays interact with the surrounding ambient gas and produce gamma rays in the vicinity of the remnant itself. The detection of this radiation can be used as an indirect proof of the fact that the supernova remnant was indeed accelerating cosmic rays in the past.},

abstract = {It has been known for over 50 years that the radio emission from shell supernova remnants (SNRs) indicates the presence of electrons with energies in the GeV range emitting synchrotron radiation. The discovery of nonthermal X-ray emission from supernova remnants is now 30 years old, and its interpretation as the extension of the radio synchrotron spectrum requires electrons with energies of up to 100 TeV. SNRs are now detected at GeV and TeV photon energies as well. Strong suggestions of the presence of energetic ions exist, but conclusive evidence remains elusive. Several arguments suggest that magnetic fields in SNRs are amplified by orders of magnitude from their values in the ambient interstellar medium. Supernova remnants are thus an excellent laboratory in which to study processes taking place in very high Mach-number shocks. I review the observations of high-energy emission from SNRs, and the theoretical framework in which those observations are interpreted.},

abstract = {We review the observations of supernova remnants (SNRs) and pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe) that give information on the strength and orientation of magnetic fields. Radio polarimetry gives the degree of order of magnetic fields, and the orientation of the ordered component. Many young shell supernova remnants show evidence for synchrotron X-ray emission. The spatial analysis of this emission suggests that magnetic fields are amplified by one to two orders of magnitude in strong shocks. Detection of several remnants in TeV gamma rays implies a lower limit on the magnetic-field strength (or a measurement, if the emission process is inverse-Compton upscattering of cosmic microwave background photons). Upper limits to GeV emission similarly provide lower limits on magnetic-field strengths. In the historical shell remnants, lower limits on B range from 25 to 1000 $\mu$G. Two remnants show variability of synchrotron X-ray emission with a timescale of years. If this timescale is the electron-acceleration or radiative loss timescale, magnetic fields of order 1 mG are also implied. In pulsar-wind nebulae, equipartition arguments and dynamical modeling can be used to infer magnetic-field strengths anywhere from ˜5 $\mu$G to 1 mG. Polarized fractions are considerably higher than in SNRs, ranging to 50 or 60% in some cases; magnetic-field geometries often suggest a toroidal structure around the pulsar, but this is not universal. Viewing-angle effects undoubtedly play a role. MHD models of radio emission in shell SNRs show that different orientations of upstream magnetic field, and different assumptions about electron acceleration, predict different radio morphology. In the remnant of SN 1006, such comparisons imply a magnetic-field orientation connecting the bright limbs, with a substantial density gradient across the remnant.},

abstract = {We review here some magnetic phenomena in astrophysical particle accelerators associated with collisionless shocks in supernova remnants, radio galaxies and clusters of galaxies. A specific feature is that the accelerated particles can play an important role in magnetic field evolution in the objects. In particular, we discuss a number of cosmic-ray (CR) driven, magnetic field amplification processes that are likely to operate when diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) becomes efficient and nonlinear. The turbulent magnetic fields produced by these processes determine the maximum energies of accelerated particles and result in specific features in the observed photon radiation of the sources. Equally important, magnetic field amplification by the CR currents and pressure anisotropies may affect the shocked gas temperatures and compression, both in the shock precursor and in the downstream flow, if the shock is an efficient CR accelerator. Strong fluctuations of the magnetic field on scales above the radiation formation length in the shock vicinity result in intermittent structures observable in synchrotron emission images. The finite size twinkling, intermittent structures---dots, clumps, and filaments---are most apparent in the cut-off region of the synchrotron spectrum. Even though these X-ray synchrotron structures result from turbulent magnetic fields, they could still be highly polarized providing an important diagnostic of the spectrum of the turbulence. We discuss both the thermal and non-thermal observational consequences of magnetic field amplification in supernova remnants and radio-galaxies. Resonant and non-resonant CR streaming instabilities in the shock precursor can generate mesoscale magnetic fields with scale-sizes comparable to supernova remnants and even superbubbles. This opens the possibility that magnetic fields in the earliest galaxies were produced by the first generation Population III supernova remnants and by clustered supernovae in star forming regions.},

abstract = {I review the observations of galactic synchrotron sources, focusing on shell supernova remnants (SNRs), with particular attention to attributes that constrain the properties of electron acceleration. Radio observations provide information on source fluxes, spectral index, morphology, and polarization. Recent observations give us strong reason to believe that several young SNRs show synchrotron X-ray emission. Even if X-rays are thermal, however, limits can be set on the maximum energy to which electrons can be accelerated without a spectral break, since no galactic SNR is observed to have X-ray emission (due to any source) as bright as the extrapolation from radio frequencies of radio synchrotron emission. If synchrotron X-rays are detected or inferred, their morphology and spectrum provide important information on mechanisms governing acceleration to the highest energies. I describe models of synchrotron emission from SNRs and their comparison with observations. Finally, I describe the tasks ahead for both observers and theoreticians, to make better use of what SNR synchrotron emission tells us about particle acceleration.},

Among them is 3EG J2020+4017, the brightest of the unidentified EGRET sources, positionally coincident with the supernova remnant G78.2+2.1. Even though the EGRET and multi-wavelength data have not provided a conclusive identification for this $\gamma$-ray loud, but otherwise faint object, the evidence favors a pulsar like source. The EGRET photon data lack the signal-to-noise ratio required for a period search, but will serve as a valuable timing baseline extension in the case that GLAST confirms the pulsar nature of the $\gamma$-Cygni source.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray emission produced by interactions between cosmic rays (CRs) and interstellar gas traces the product of their densities throughout the Milky Way. The outer Galaxy is a privileged target of investigation to separate interstellar structures seen along the line of sight. Recent observations by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) shed light on open questions of the EGRET era about the distribution of CR densities and the census of the interstellar medium. The gradient of gamma-ray emissivities measured in the outer Galaxy is significantly flatter than predictions from widely used CR propagation models given the rapid decline of putative CR sources beyond the solar circle. Large propagation volumes, with halo heights up to 20 kpc, or a flat CR source distribution are required to match the data. Other viable possibilities include non-uniform CR diffusion properties or more gas than accounted for by the radio/mm-wave data. Gamma-ray data constrain the evolution of the Xco=N(H2)/W(CO) ratio within a few kpc from the Sun. There is a significant increase by a factor 2 from nearby clouds in the Gould Belt to the local spur. No further significant variations are measured from the local spur to the Perseus spiral arm. At the level of statistical accuracy provided by the LAT data, the most important source of uncertainty, often overlooked so far, is due to the optical depth correction applied to derive the column densities of H I. Reliable determinations of the amount of atomic gas in the plane are key to better probe the properties of CRs in the Galaxy.},

The X-ray source position is R.A. 20h21m30.733s, Decl. +40 deg 26 min 46.04sec (J2000) with an estimated uncertainty of 1.3 arsec combined statistical and systematic error. Moreover, both the X-ray to gamma-ray and the X-ray to optical flux ratios are sensible assuming a neutron star origin for the X-ray flux. The X-ray source has no cataloged infrared-to-visible counterpart and, through new observations, we set upper limits to its optical emission of i' >23.0 mag and r' > 25.2mag. The source exhibits an X-ray spectrum with most likely both a powerlaw and a thermal component. We also report on the X-ray and visible light properties of the 43 other sources detected in our Chandra observation.},

Here, we describe two separate gamma-ray (photon energy greater than 100 mega-electron volts) flares from this source detected by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The first flare occurred in February 2009 and lasted approximately 16 days. The second flare was detected in September 2010 and lasted approximately 4 days. During these outbursts, the gamma-ray flux from the nebula increased by factors of four and six, respectively. The brevity of the flares implies that the gamma rays were emitted via synchrotron radiation from peta-electron-volt (1015 electron volts) electrons in a region smaller than 1.4 × 10-2 parsecs. These are the highest-energy particles that can be associated with a discrete astronomical source, and they pose challenges to particle acceleration theory.},

abstract = {The extragalactic background light (EBL) includes photons with wavelengths from ultraviolet to infrared, which are effective at attenuating gamma rays with energy above ~10 GeV during propagation from sources at cosmological distances. This results in a redshift- and energy-dependent attenuation of the $\gamma$-ray flux of extragalactic sources such as blazars and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The Large Area Telescope on board Fermi detects a sample of $\gamma$-ray blazars with redshift up to z ~ 3, and GRBs with redshift up to z ~ 4.3. Using photons above 10 GeV collected by Fermi over more than one year of observations for these sources, we investigate the effect of $\gamma$-ray flux attenuation by the EBL. We place upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray opacity of the universe at various energies and redshifts and compare this with predictions from well-known EBL models. We find that an EBL intensity in the optical-ultraviolet wavelengths as great as predicted by the "baseline" model of Stecker et al. can be ruled out with high confidence.},

abstract = {We report the detection of pulsed gamma-rays from the young, spin-powered radio pulsar PSR J2021+3651 using data acquired with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly GLAST). The light curve consists of two narrow peaks of similar amplitude separated by 0.468 $\pm$ 0.002 in phase. The first peak lags the maximum of the 2 GHz radio pulse by 0.162 $\pm$ 0.004 $\pm$ 0.01 in phase. The integral gamma-ray photon flux above 100 MeV is (56 $\pm$ 3 $\pm$ 11) × 10-8 cm-2 s-1. The photon spectrum is well described by an exponentially cut-off power law of the form {dF \over dE} = kE^{-$\Gamma$} e^{(-E/E_c)}, where the energy E is expressed in GeV. The photon index is $\Gamma$ = 1.5 $\pm$ 0.1 $\pm$ 0.1 and the exponential cut-off is Ec = 2.4 $\pm$ 0.3 $\pm$ 0.5 GeV. The first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The integral photon flux of the bridge is approximately 10% of the pulsed emission, and the upper limit on off-pulse gamma-ray emission from a putative pulsar wind nebula is < 10% of the pulsed emission at the 95% confidence level. Radio polarization measurements yield a rotation measure of RM = 524 $\pm$ 4 rad m-2 but a poorly constrained magnetic geometry. Re-analysis of Chandra X-ray Observatory data enhanced the significance of the weak X-ray pulsations, and the first peak is roughly phase aligned with the first gamma-ray peak. We discuss the emission region and beaming geometry based on the shape and spectrum of the gamma-ray light curve combined with radio and X-ray measurements, and the implications for the pulsar distance. Gamma-ray emission from the polar cap region seems unlikely for this pulsar.},

abstract = {Context. Identification of $\gamma$-ray-emitting Galactic sources is a long-standing problem in astrophysics. One such source, 1AGL J2022+4032, coincident with the interior of the radio shell of the supernova remnant Gamma Cygni (SNR G78.2+2.1) in the Cygnus region, has recently been identified by Fermi as a $\gamma$-ray pulsar, LAT PSR J2021+4026. Aims: We present long-term observations of 1AGL J2022+4032 with the AGILE $\gamma$-ray telescope, measuring its flux and light curve. Methods: We compare the light curve of 1AGL J2022+4032 with that of 1AGL J2021+3652 (PSR J2021+3651), showing that the flux variability of 1AGL J2022+4032 appears to be greater than the level predicted from statistical and systematic effects and producing detailed simulations to estimate the probability of the apparent observed variability. Results: We evaluate the possibility that the $\gamma$-ray emission may be due to the superposition of two or more point sources, some of which may be variable, considering a number of possible counterparts. Conclusions: We consider the possibility of a nearby X-ray quiet microquasar contributing to the flux of 1AGL J2022+4032 to be more likely than the hypotheses of a background blazar or intrinsic $\gamma$-ray variabilty of LAT PSR J2021+4026.},

abstract = {Diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission produced by the interaction of cosmic-ray particles with matter and radiation in the Galaxy can be used to probe the distribution of cosmic rays and their sources in different regions of the Galaxy. With its large field of view and long observation time, the Milagro Gamma Ray Observatory is an ideal instrument for surveying large regions of the northern hemisphere sky and for detecting diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission at very high energies. Here the spatial distribution and the flux of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the TeV energy range with a median energy of 15 TeV for Galactic longitude between 30$\,^{\circ}$ and 110$\,^{\circ}$ and between 136$\,^{\circ}$ and 216$\,^{\circ}$ and for Galactic latitude between -10$\,^{\circ}$ and 10$\,^{\circ}$ are determined. The measured fluxes are consistent with predictions of the GALPROP model everywhere, except for the Cygnus region (l∈[65deg,85deg]). For the Cygnus region, the flux is twice the predicted value. This excess can be explained by the presence of active cosmic-ray sources accelerating hadrons, which interact with the local dense interstellar medium and produce gamma rays through pion decay.},

abstract = {Aims: The Galactic object G78.2+2.1 is a classical shell-type supernova remnant. Previous radio continuum studies have shown substantial variations in spectral index across the object. Existing studies of the neutral hydrogen are of relatively low resolution and sensitivity. Much higher sensitivity and resolution data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey justify a re-examination of the properties of this SNR. Methods: In order to improve the accuracy of spectral index determination and its spatial variation, we first remove the underlying thermal emission with the use of a correlation between the 60~$\mu$m infrared continuum and 1420 MHz radio continuum. We use the so-called TT-plot technique to obtain the continuum spectral index between 408 and 1420 MHz. We also apply a ``tomography'' technique to investigate the spectral index variations, while keeping the full resolution of the data. Complementary X-ray and infrared data are used to study associated structures in both continuum and in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen. Results: The spectral index $\alpha$ (S$\nu$ ∝ $\nu$-$\alpha$) averaged over the SNR is 0.75 $\pm$ 0.03, significantly higher than previous studies. The TT-plots and tomography image show spatial variations ranging from as low as 0.40 to as high as 0.80. Two complementary neutral hydrogen structures at LSR velocities of 5.5 and -14~km s-1, respectively, are shown to circumscribe the continuum emission. A number of scenarios are presented to account for the observed properties. A faint shell to the north-west of the SNR is visible in both radio and infrared continuum as well as in neutral hydrogen, and could be associated with a local blowout of the SNR blast wave into a medium of lower density. An isolated cloudlet probably accelerated by the SNR blast wave shows considerable structure in neutral hydrogen emission, suggesting the cloudlet is either beginning to dissolve within the SNR or is interacting with neighbouring gas. The previously proposed cloudlet at ~-117~km s-1 is not isolated, but is part of a more extended structure, and is thus unlikely an accelerated cloudlet.},

Most of the strong evidence against a young age for 3C 58 relies heavily on the assumed distance of 3.2 kpc determined with H I absorption measurements. I have revisited this distance determination based on new H I data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey and added newly determined distances to objects in the neighbourhood, which are based on direct measurements by trigonometric parallax. This leads to a new and more reliable distance estimate of 2 kpc for 3C 58 and makes the connection between the pulsar wind nebula and the historical event from A.D. 1181 once again much more compelling.},

The images are dominated by localized clumps of about ten arcmin in size. The flux of the most prominent North-Western (NW) clump is (1.7$\pm$0.4)×10-11 erg cm-2 s-1 in the 25-40 keV band. The observed X-ray fluxes are in agreement with extrapolations of soft X-ray imaging observations of $\gamma$-Cyg by ASCA GIS and spatially unresolved RXTE PCA data. The positions of the hard X-ray clumps correlate with bright patches of optical line emission, possibly indicating the presence of radiative shock waves in a shocked cloud. The observed spatial structure and spectra are consistent with model predictions of hard X-ray emission from nonthermal electrons accelerated by a radiative shock in a supernova interacting with an interstellar cloud, but the powerful stellar wind of the O9V star HD 193322 is a plausible candidate for the NW source as well.},

abstract = {With the ASCA X-ray satellite, we perform spatial and spectral studies of the shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) $\gamma$ Cygni that is associated with the brightest EGRET unidentified source 3EG J2020+4017. At energies below 3 keV, the bulk of the X-ray flux from the remnant is well described by the emission of thermal plasma with characteristic temperature kTe~=0.5-0.9 keV. In addition to this thermal emission, we found an extremely hard X-ray component from several clumps localized in the northern part of the remnant. This component, which dominates the X-ray emission from the remnant above 4 keV, is described by a power law with a photon index of $\Gamma$~=0.8-1.5. Both the absolute flux and the spectral shape of the nonthermal X-rays cannot be explained by the synchrotron or inverse-Compton mechanisms. We argue that the unusually hard X-ray spectrum can be interpreted naturally in terms of nonthermal bremsstrahlung from Coulomb-loss-flattened electron distribution in dense environs with the gas density about 10-100 cm-3. For a given spectrum of the electron population, the ratio of the bremsstrahlung X- and $\gamma$-ray fluxes depends on the position of the ``Coulomb break'' in the electron spectrum. Formally, the entire high-energy $\gamma$-ray flux detected by EGRET from $\gamma$ Cygni could originate in the hard X-ray regions. However, it is more likely that the bulk of $\gamma$-rays detected by EGRET comes from the radio-bright and X-ray-dim cloud at the southeast, where the very dense gas and strong magnetic field would illuminate the cloud in the radio and $\gamma$-ray bands but suppress the bremsstrahlung X-ray emission due to the shift of the Coulomb break in the electron spectrum toward higher energies.},

It is also home to a number of GeV gamma-ray sources, including no less than four new high-significance sources detected in the first six months of Fermi data. The VERITAS survey, comprising more than 140 hours of observations, reaches an average VHE point-source flux sensitivity of better than 4% of the Crab Nebula flux at energies above 200 GeV.

abstract = {We report observations with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory of a field in the $\gamma$-Cygni supernova remnant (SNR 78.2+2.1) centered on the cataloged location of the unidentified, bright $\gamma$-ray source 3EG J2020+4017. In this search for an X-ray counterpart to the $\gamma$-ray source, we detected 30 X-ray sources. Of these, we found 17 strong-candidate counterparts in optical (visible through near-infrared) cataloged and an additional three through our optical observations. Based on colors and (for several objects) optical spectra, nearly all the optically identified objects appear to be reddened main-sequence stars: none of the X-ray sources with an optical counterpart is a plausible X-ray counterpart to 3EG J2020+4017-if that $\gamma$-ray source is a spin-powered pulsar. Many of the 10 X-ray sources lacking optical counterparts are likely (extragalactic) active galactic nuclei, based on the sky density of such sources. Although one of the 10 optically unidentified X-ray sources could be the $\gamma$-ray source, there is no auxiliary evidence supporting such an identification.},

abstract = {In search of the counterpart to the brightest unidentified gamma-ray source, 3EG J2020+4017 (2CG 078+2), we report on new X-ray and radio observations of the $\gamma$ Cygni field with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We also report on reanalysis of archival ROSAT data. With Chandra it became possible for the first time to measure the position of the putative gamma-ray counterpart, RX J2020.2+4026, with subarcsecond accuracy and to deduce its X-ray spectral characteristics. These observations demonstrate that RX J2020.2+4026 is associated with a K field star and therefore is unlikely to be the counterpart of the bright gamma-ray source 2CG 078+2 in the SNR G78.2+2.1 as had been previously suggested. The Chandra observation detected 37 additional X-ray sources, which were correlated with catalogs of optical and infrared data. Subsequent GBT radio observations covered the complete 99% EGRET likelihood contour of 3EG J2020+4017 with a sensitivity limit of L820~0.1 mJy kpc2, which is lower than most of the recent deep radio search limits. If there is a pulsar operating in 3EG J2020+4017, this sensitivity limit suggests that either the pulsar does not produce significant amounts of radio emission or that its geometry is such that the radio beam does not intersect with the line of sight. Finally, reanalysis of archival ROSAT data leads to a flux upper limit of fX(0.1-2.4keV)<1.8×10-13 ergs s-1 cm-2 for a putative pointlike X-ray source located within the 68% confidence contour of 3EG J2020+4017. Adopting the supernova remnant age of 5400 yr and assuming a spin-down to X-ray energy conversion factor of 10-4, this upper limit constrains the parameters of a putative neutron star as a counterpart for 3EG J2020+4017 to be P >~ 160 (d 1.5 kpc)-1 ms, P>~5×10-13 (d 1.5 kpc-1)-1 s s-1, and B⊥>~9×1012 (d 1.5 kpc)-1 G.},

abstract = {Context. The Cygnus region hosts a giant molecular-cloud complex that actively forms massive stars. Interactions of cosmic rays with interstellar gas and radiation fields make it shine at $\gamma$-ray energies. Several $\gamma$-ray pulsars and other energetic sources are seen in this direction. Aims: In this paper we analyze the $\gamma$-ray emission measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the energy range from 100 MeV to 100 GeV in order to probe the gas and cosmic-ray content on the scale of the whole Cygnus complex. The $\gamma$-ray emission on the scale of the central massive stellar clusters and from individual sources is addressed elsewhere. Methods: The signal from bright pulsars is greatly reduced by selecting photons in their off-pulse phase intervals. We compare the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission with interstellar gas maps derived from radio/mm-wave lines and visual extinction data. A general model of the region, including other pulsars and $\gamma$-ray sources, is sought. Results: The integral H i emissivity above 100 MeV averaged over the whole Cygnus complex amounts to [2.06 $\pm$ 0.11 (stat.) -0.84+0.15(syst.)] × 10-26 photons s-1 sr-1 H-atom-1, where the systematic error is dominated by the uncertainty on the H i opacity to calculate its column densities. The integral emissivity and its spectral energy distribution are both consistent within the systematics with LAT measurements in the interstellar space near the solar system. The average XCO = N(H2)/WCO ratio is found to be [1.68 $\pm$ 0.05 (stat.) -0.10+0.87(HI opacity)] × 1020 molecules cm-2 (K km s-1)-1, consistent with other LAT measurements in the Local Arm. We detect significant $\gamma$-ray emission from dark neutral gas for a mass corresponding to ~40% of what is traced by CO. The total interstellar mass in the Cygnus complex inferred from its $\gamma$-ray emission amounts to 8-1+5 × 106 M{\&}sun; at a distance of 1.4 kpc. Conclusions: Despite the conspicuous star formation activity and high masses of the interstellar clouds, the cosmic-ray population in the Cygnus complex averaged over a few hundred parsecs is similar to that of the local interstellar space.},

Studies of GeV and TeV gamma-ray emission in the vicinity of SNRs, in combination with multi-wavelength observations, can trace and constrain the nature of the charged particle population believed to be accelerated within SNR shocks. They may also speak to the diffusion and propagation of these energetic particles and to the nature of the acceleration mechanisms involved.

-Really good paper!
-Good summary of history of SNR cosmic rays and gamma ray astronomy
-why use gamma rays to study cosmic ray origin
-Hadronic/Leptonic description
-Why Fermi and IACT are good
-For SNR with GeV and TeV detections, the GeV is often brighter in terms of energy flux due to spectral steepening arising at a few GeV, which makes the GeV observations important.

abstract = {In the past few years, gamma-ray astronomy has entered a golden age. At TeV energies, only a handful of sources were known a decade ago, but the current generation of ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes has increased this number to more than one hundred. At GeV energies, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has increased the number of known sources by nearly an order of magnitude in its first 2 years of operation. The recent detection and unprecedented morphological studies of gamma-ray emission from shell-type supernova remnants is of great interest, as these analyses are directly linked to the long standing issue of the origin of the cosmic-rays. However, these detections still do not constitute a conclusive proof that supernova remnants accelerate the bulk of Galactic cosmic-rays, mainly due to the difficulty of disentangling the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the observed gamma-ray emission. In this talk, I will review the most relevant cosmic ray related results of gamma ray astronomy concerning supernova remnants.},

abstract = {We present the AGILE gamma-ray observations in the energy range 50 MeV-10 GeV of the supernova remnant (SNR) W44, one of the most interesting systems for studying cosmic-ray production. W44 is an intermediate-age SNR (~20, 000 years) and its ejecta expand in a dense medium as shown by a prominent radio shell, nearby molecular clouds, and bright [S II] emitting regions. We extend our gamma-ray analysis to energies substantially lower than previous measurements which could not conclusively establish the nature of the radiation. We find that gamma-ray emission matches remarkably well both the position and shape of the inner SNR shocked plasma. Furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum shows a prominent peak near 1 GeV with a clear decrement at energies below a few hundreds of MeV as expected from neutral pion decay. Here we demonstrate that (1) hadron-dominated models are consistent with all W44 multiwavelength constraints derived from radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations; (2) ad hoc lepton-dominated models fail to explain simultaneously the well-constrained gamma-ray and radio spectra, and require a circumstellar density much larger than the value derived from observations; and (3) the hadron energy spectrum is well described by a power law (with index s = 3.0 $\pm$ 0.1) and a low-energy cut-off at Ec = 6 $\pm$ 1 GeV. Direct evidence for pion emission is then established in an SNR for the first time.},

No signal from MGRO J2019+37 is detected by the ARGO-YBJ experiment, and the derived flux upper limits at the 90% confidence level for all the events above 600 GeV with medium energy of 3 TeV are lower than the Milagro flux, implying that the source might be variable and hard to be identified as a pulsar wind nebula.

abstract = {Galactic cosmic rays are believed to be accelerated at supernova remnant shocks. Though very popular and robust, this conjecture still needs a conclusive proof. The strongest support to this idea is probably the fact that supernova remnants are observed in gamma-rays, which are indeed expected as the result of the hadronic interactions between the cosmic rays accelerated at the shock and the ambient gas. However, also leptonic processes can, in most cases, explain the observed gamma-ray emission. This implies that the detections in gamma rays do not necessarily mean that supernova remnants accelerate cosmic ray protons. To overcome this degeneracy, the multi-wavelength emission (from radio to gamma rays) from individual supernova remnants has been studied and in a few cases it has been possible to ascribe the gamma-ray emission to one of the two processes (hadronic or leptonic). Here we adopt a different approach and, instead of a case-by-case study we aim for a population study and we compute the number of supernova remnants which are expected to be seen in TeV gamma rays above a given flux under the assumption that these objects indeed are the sources of cosmic rays. The predictions found here match well with current observational results, thus providing a novel consistency check for the supernova remnant paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays. Moreover, hints are presented for the fact that particle spectra significantly steeper than E^-2 are produced at supernova remnants. Finally, we expect that several of the supernova remnants detected by H.E.S.S. in the survey of the galactic plane should exhibit a gamma-ray emission dominated by hadronic processes (i.e. neutral pion decay). The fraction of the detected remnants for which the leptonic emission dominates over the hadronic one depends on the assumed values of the physical parameters and can be as high as roughly a half.},

abstract = {The Cygnus region is a nearby very active star forming region, containing several OB associations, considered as tracers of young pulsars. Above 12 TeV, the Milagro Collaboration has reported the discovery of a very large source, MGRO J2019+37, lying towards the Cyg OB1 association, at the edge of the Cygnus region. The young and energetic pulsar PSR J2021+3651 has been proposed to power this emission. We present here the result of deep VERITAS observations of this region at energies above 650 GeV. These observations unveil extended and complex TeV emission compatible with MGRO J2019+37, likely made of multiple sources, and a clearly separated point source emission from the direction of CTB 87, a pulsar wind nebula candidate. We will also report on the detection of TeV emission from the young Galactic SNR CTA 1, likely powered by the first pulsar discovered through its gamma-ray radiation.},

abstract = {The Cygnus region is a very bright and complex portion of the TeV sky, host to unidentified sources and a diffuse excess with respect to conventional cosmic-ray propagation models. Two of the brightest TeV sources, MGRO J2019+37 and MGRO J2031+41, are analyzed using Milagro data with a new technique, and their emission is tested under two different spectral assumptions: a power law and a power law with an exponential cutoff. The new analysis technique is based on an energy estimator that uses the fraction of photomultiplier tubes in the observatory that detect the extensive air shower. The photon spectrum is measured in the range 1 to 200 TeV using the last 3 years of Milagro data (2005-2008), with the detector in its final configuration. MGRO J2019+37 is detected with a significance of 12.3 standard deviations ($\sigma$), and is better fit by a power law with an exponential cutoff than by a simple power law, with a probability $>98$% (F-test). The best-fitting parameters for the power law with exponential cutoff model are a normalization at 10 TeV of $7^{+5}_{-2}\times10^{-10}$ $\mathrm{s^{-1}\: m^{-2}\: TeV^{-1}}$, a spectral index of $2.0^{+0.5}_{-1.0}$ and a cutoff energy of $29^{+50}_{-16}$ TeV. MGRO J2031+41 is detected with a significance of 7.3$\sigma$, with no evidence of a cutoff. The best-fitting parameters for a power law are a normalization of $2.4^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\times10^{-10}$ $\mathrm{s^{-1}\: m^{-2}\: TeV^{-1}}$ and a spectral index of $3.08^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$. The overall flux is subject to an $\sim$30% systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty on the power law indices is $\sim$0.1. A comparison with previous results from TeV J2032+4130, MGRO J2031+41 and MGRO J2019+37 is also presented.},

abstract = {The gamma-ray emission associated with radio-bright supernova remnants has been studied using data from the EGRET instrument aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Five sources from The Second EGRET Catalog of High-Energy Gamma-Ray Sources are shown to be coincident with supernova remnants. The two strongest pointlike gamma-ray excesses which are coincident with supernova remnants are 2EG J2020+4026 with y Cyg and 2EG J0618+2234 with IC 443. The gamma-ray flux, E > 100 MeV, from the region of these two supernova remnants is (12.6$\pm$0.7) x 10-7 photons cm-2 s-1 and (5.0$\pm$0.4) x 10-7 photons cm-2 s-1, respectively. The differential gamma-ray flux of both supernova remnants is consistent with a single power law, F ∝ E-$\alpha$, with $\alpha$ = 2.07$\pm$0.05 and 1.97$\pm$0.07 for $\gamma$ Cyg and IC 443, respectively. A cosmic-ray origin model based on shock acceleration of cosmic rays is consistent with our results suggesting supernova remnants as an acceleration site, and possibly the origin, of Galactic cosmic rays. Other mechanisms to explain the possible gamma-ray emission from supernova remnants are also discussed in the context of the EGRET observations.},

abstract = {All $\gamma$-ray telescopes suffer from source confusion due to their inability to focus incident high-energy radiation, and the resulting background contamination can obscure the periodic emission from faint pulsars. In the context of the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we outline enhanced statistical tests for pulsation in which each photon is weighted by its probability to have originated from the candidate pulsar. The probabilities are calculated using the instrument response function and a full spectral model, enabling powerful background rejection. With Monte Carlo methods, we demonstrate that the new tests increase the sensitivity to pulsars by more than 50% under a wide range of conditions. This improvement may appreciably increase the completeness of the sample of radio-loud $\gamma$-ray pulsars. Finally, we derive the asymptotic null distribution for the H-test, expanding its domain of validity to arbitrarily complex light curves.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope allows detection of thousands of new gamma-ray sources and detailed characterization of the spectra and variability of bright sources. Unsurprisingly, this increased capability leads to increased complexity in data analysis. Likelihood methods are ideal for connecting models with data, but the computational cost of folding the model input through the multi-scale instrument response function is appreciable. Both interactive analysis and large projects---such as analysis of the full gamma-ray sky---can be prohibitive or impossible, reducing the scope of the science possible with the LAT. To improve on this situation, we have developed pointlike, a software package for fast maximum likelihood analysis of LAT data. It is interactive by design and its rapid evaluation of the likelihood facilitates exploratory and large-scale, all-sky analysis. We detail its implementation and validate its performance on simulated data. We demonstrate its capability for interactive analysis and present several all-sky analyses. These include a search for new gamma-ray sources and the selection of LAT sources with pulsar-like characteristics for targeted radio pulsation searches. We conclude by developing sensitive periodicity tests incorporating spectral information obtained from pointlike.},

abstract = {Aims: We present a detailed X-ray and radio wavelength study of G308.4-1.4, a candidate supernova remnant (SNR) in the ROSAT All Sky Survey and the MOST supernova remnant catalogue. Methods: The SNR candidate and its central point sources were studied using observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, SWIFT, the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 1.4 and 2.5 GHz and WISE infrared observation at 24 $\mu$m. Results: We conclude that G308.4-1.4 is indeed a supernova remnant by means of its morphology matching at X-ray, radio and infrared wavelength, its spectral energy distribution in the X-ray band and its emission characteristics in the radio band. G308.4-1.4 is a shell-type SNR. X-ray, radio and infrared emission is seen only in the eastern part of the remnant due to a strong spatial density variation of the interstellar medium around the remnant. The X-ray emission can best be described by an absorbed non-equilibrium collisional plasma with a hydrogen density of $n_\text{H}=(1.02\pm 0.04)$ cm$^{-2}$, a plasma temperature of $6.3^{+1.2}_{-0.7}$ million Kelvin and an under-abundance of Iron, Neon and Magnesium, as well as an overabundance in Sulfur with respect to the solar values. A Sedov analysis revealed that the remnant is at a distance of $ \approx 10$ kpc and the progenitor star exploded $\sim 5000$ to 7500 years ago. Two faint X-ray point sources located near to the remnant's geometrical center are detected. Both sources have no counterpart at other wavelengths, leaving them as candidates for the compact remnant of the supernova explosion.},

abstract = {We present results of semianalytic calculations which show clear evidence for changes in the nonequilibrium ionization behind a supernova remnant forward shock undergoing efficient diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). The efficient acceleration of particles (i.e., cosmic rays (CRs)) lowers the shock temperature and raises the density of the shocked gas, thus altering the ionization state of the plasma in comparison to the test-particle (TP) approximation where CRs gain an insignificant fraction of the shock energy. The differences between the TP and efficient acceleration cases are substantial and occur for both slow and fast temperature equilibration rates: in cases of higher acceleration efficiency, particular ion states are more populated at lower electron temperatures. We also present results which show that, in the efficient shock acceleration case, higher ionization fractions are reached noticeably closer to the shock front than in the TP case, clearly indicating that DSA may enhance thermal X-ray production. We attribute this to the higher postshock densities which lead to faster electron temperature equilibration and higher ionization rates. These spatial differences should be resolvable with current and future X-ray missions, and can be used as diagnostics in estimating the acceleration efficiency in CR-modified shocks.},

abstract = {Recent calculations of particle acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) are used to estimate the associated $\gamma$-ray production. For source spectra which are power-laws in momentum (or rigidity) the production efficiency of $\gamma$-rays with energy Egamma_>100MeV is shown to be about a factor 2-3 lower than the value conventionally used for the interstellar medium and to depend only weakly on the spectral index of the power-law (in the range expected). Because the energy transferred to accelerated particles is rather tightly constrained by the total Galactic cosmic ray power, if SNRs are the main source of Galactic cosmic rays, this leads to an almost model-independent prediction of the SNR $\gamma$-ray luminosity in the band Egamma_>100MeV. A detailed discussion of instrumental sensitivities and backgrounds shows that detection of SNRs in the Egamma_>100MeV band with, for example, the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) will be difficult, but should not be impossible. However, and significantly, the prospects look much better in the TeV band accessible to modern imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. It should be possible to detect SNRs out to distances of several kpc if the region of the ISM into which they are expanding has a high enough density (n>0.1cm^-3^) so that their $\gamma$-ray luminosity is high enough. Finally, it is pointed out that existing and planned air-shower arrays can place important limits on the extension of the accelerated particle spectra in SNRs to energies above 100TeV. In conjunction with spectral measurements in the TeV region and detections or upper limits in the 100MeV band this could provide a crucial test of current theories of particle acceleration in SNRs.},

abstract = {Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) are widely believed to be accelerated by shock waves associated with the expansion of supernova ejecta into the interstellar medium. A key issue in this long-standing conjecture is a theoretical prediction that the interstellar magnetic field can be substantially amplified at the shock of a young supernova remnant (SNR) through magnetohydrodynamic waves generated by cosmic rays. Here we report a discovery of the brightening and decay of X-ray hot spots in the shell of the SNR RXJ1713.7-3946 on a one-year timescale. This rapid variability shows that the X-rays are produced by ultrarelativistic electrons through a synchrotron process and that electron acceleration does indeed take place in a strongly magnetized environment, indicating amplification of the magnetic field by a factor of more than 100. The X-ray variability also implies that we have witnessed the ongoing shock-acceleration of electrons in real time. Independently, broadband X-ray spectrometric measurements of RXJ1713.7-3946 indicate that electron acceleration proceeds in the most effective (`Bohm-diffusion') regime. Taken together, these two results provide a strong argument for acceleration of protons and nuclei to energies of 1PeV (1015eV) and beyond in young supernova remnants.},

Crucial for the theory of Galactic cosmic-ray origin is whether the gamma-rays from SNRs are produced by accelerated hadrons (protons and ions), or by relativistic electrons. Here we show that the broadband radiation spectrum of Tycho can be explained within the framework of a two-zone leptonic model, which is likely to apply to every SNR. A model with hadrons can also fit the radiation spectrum. The hadronic origin of gamma-rays can be confirmed by Fermi spectral measurements of Tycho and other SNRs at energies below ~300 MeV.},

Three crucial problems are identified: injection, maximum achievable particle energy and spectral index. In each case significant new advances in understanding have been achieved, which cast doubt on prevailing paradigms such as Bohm diffusion and single-fluid MHD. This indicates that more realistic analytical models, backed by more sophisticated numerical techniques should be employed to obtain reliable predictions. Preliminary work on incorporating the effects of anomalous transport suggest that the resulting spectrum should be significantly softer than that predicted by conventional theory. },

abstract = {Pulsars are thought to eject electron-positron winds that energize the surrounding environment, with the formation of a pulsar wind nebula. The pulsar wind originates close to the light cylinder, the surface at which the pulsar co-rotation velocity equals the speed of light, and carries away much of the rotational energy lost by the pulsar. Initially the wind is dominated by electromagnetic energy (Poynting flux) but later this is converted to the kinetic energy of bulk motion. It is unclear exactly where this takes place and to what speed the wind is accelerated. Although some preferred models imply a gradual acceleration over the entire distance from the magnetosphere to the point at which the wind terminates, a rapid acceleration close to the light cylinder cannot be excluded. Here we report that the recent observations of pulsed, very high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from the Crab pulsar are explained by the presence of a cold (in the sense of the low energy of the electrons in the frame of the moving plasma) ultrarelativistic wind dominated by kinetic energy. The conversion of the Poynting flux to kinetic energy should take place abruptly in the narrow cylindrical zone of radius between 20 and 50 light-cylinder radii centred on the axis of rotation of the pulsar, and should accelerate the wind to a Lorentz factor of (0.5-1.0)×106. Although the ultrarelativistic nature of the wind does support the general model of pulsars, the requirement of the very high acceleration of the wind in a narrow zone not far from the light cylinder challenges current models.},

It is the most distant pulsar wind nebula ever detected in VHE gamma-rays. Another very exciting target is SN 1987A, the remnant of the most recent supernova explosion that occurred in the neighbourhood of the Milky Way. Models for Cosmic Ray acceleration in this remnant predict gamma-ray emission at a level detectable by H.E.S.S. but this has not been detected so far. Fermi/LAT discovered diffuse high energy (HE) gamma-ray emission from the general direction of the massive star forming region 30 Doradus but no clear evidence for emission from either N 157B or SN 1987A has been published. The part of the LMC containing these objects has been observed regularly with the H.E.S.S. telescopes since 2003. With deep observations carried out in 2010 a very good exposure of this part of the sky has been obtained. The current status of the H.E.S.S. LMC observations is reported along with new results on N 157B and SN 1987A.},

Tracers for interactions of Cosmic Rays with ambient material are gamma rays at TeV energies, which can be observed with ground based Cherenkov telescopes like H.E.S.S. In the recent years H.E.S.S. has detected several SNRs and interactions of SNRs with molecular clouds.

The electron continuity equation is analytically solved assuming that the nonthermal electron injection power is proportional to the rate at which the kinetic energy of matter swept up in an adiabatically expanding SNR shell. We apply this model to \fermi\ and HESS data from the SNR \rxj, and find that a one-zone leptonic model with Compton-scattered cosmic microwave background (CMB) and interstellar infrared photons has difficulty providing a good fit to its spectral energy distribution, provided the source is at a distance $\sim 1\ \kpc$ from the Earth. However, the inclusion of multiple zones, as hinted at by recent {\em Chandra} observations, does provide a good fit, but requires a second zone of compact knots with magnetic fields $B\sim 16\ \mu$G, comparable to shock-compressed fields found in the bulk of the remnant.},

abstract = {We wish to constrain the cosmic-ray proton (CRp) population in galaxy clusters. By hadronic interactions with the thermal gas of the intra-cluster medium (ICM), the CRp produce $\gamma$-rays for which we develop an analytic formalism to deduce their spectral distribution. Assuming the CRp-to-thermal energy density ratio XCRp and the CRp spectral index to be spatially constant, we derive an analytic relation between the $\gamma$-ray and bolometric X-ray fluxes, F$\gamma$ and FX. Based on our relation, we compile a sample of suitable clusters which are promising candidates for future detection of $\gamma$-rays resulting from hadronic CRp interactions. Comparing to EGRET upper limits, we constrain the CRp population in the cooling flow clusters Perseus and Virgo to XCRp < 20%. Assuming a plausible value for the CRp diffusion coefficient $\kappa$, we find the central CRp injection luminosity of M 87 to be limited to 1043 erg s-1 $\kappa$/(1029 cm2 s-1). The synchrotron emission from secondary electrons generated in CRp hadronic interactions allows even tighter limits to be placed on the CRp population using radio observations. We obtain excellent agreement between the observed and theoretical radio brightness profiles for Perseus, but not for Coma without a radially increasing CRp-to-thermal energy density profile. Since the CRp and magnetic energy densities necessary to reproduce the observed radio flux are very plausible, we propose synchrotron emission from secondary electrons as an attractive explanation of the radio mini-halos found in cooling flow clusters. This model can be tested with future sensitive $\gamma$-ray observations of the accompanying pi0-decays. We identify Perseus (A 426), Virgo, Ophiuchus, and Coma (A 1656) as the most promising candidate clusters for such observations.},

The probability that the association of strong EGRET sources with supernova remnants is due to chance alignment is found to be <=1/2200. Three of the most convincing associations are radio-bright, nearby shell remnants and a fourth is associated with a plerion. We examine possible gamma-ray production mechanisms and conclude that pion production and decay from high-energy protons interacting with the remnant gas could produce the gamma rays. The energetics of this process are in accord with theories of cosmic ray production through supernova shock acceleration. The identification of $\pi$^0^-decay features in the gamma-ray spectra of supernova remnants would support this interpretation.},

abstract = {Diffusive shock acceleration at the outer front of expanding supernova remnants has provided by far the most popular model for the origin of galactic cosmic rays, and has been the subject of intensive theoretical investigation. But several problems loomed at high energies---how to explain the smooth continuation of the cosmic-ray spectrum far beyond 1014 eV, the very low level of TeV gamma-ray emission from several supernova remnants, and the very low anisotropy of cosmic rays (seeming to conflict with the short trapping times needed to convert a E-2 source spectrum into the observed E-2.7 spectrum of cosmic rays). However, recent work on the cosmic ray spectrum (especially at KASCADE) strongly indicates that about half of the flux does turn down rather sharply near 3 × 1015 V rigidity, with a distinct tail extending to just beyond 1017 V rigidity; whilst a plausible description (Bell and Lucek) of the level of self-generated magnetic fields at the shock fronts of young supernova remnants implies that many SNRs in varying environments might very well generate spectra extending smoothly to just this 'knee' position, and a portion of the exploding red supergiants could extend the spectrum approximately as needed. At low energies, recent progress in relating cosmic ray compositional details to modified shock structure also adds weight to the belief that the model is working on the right lines, converting energy into cosmic rays very efficiently where injection can occur. The low level of TeV gamma-ray flux from many young SNRs is a serious challenge, though it may relate to variations in particle injection efficiency with time. The clear detection of TeV gamma rays from SNRs has now just begun, and predictions of a characteristic curved particle spectrum give a target for new tests by TeV observations. However, the isotropy seriously challenges the assumed cosmic-ray trapping time and hence the shape of the spectrum of particles released from SNRs. There is otherwise enough convergence of model and observation to encourage belief that the outline of the model is right, but there remains the possibility that the spectral shape of particles actually released is not as previously predicted.},

abstract = {We present the second catalog of high-energy $\gamma$-ray sources detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT), the primary science instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi), derived from data taken during the first 24 months of the science phase of the mission, which began on 2008 August 4. Source detection is based on the average flux over the 24 month period. The second Fermi-LAT catalog (2FGL) includes source location regions, defined in terms of elliptical fits to the 95% confidence regions and spectral fits in terms of power-law, exponentially cutoff power-law, or log-normal forms. Also included are flux measurements in five energy bands and light curves on monthly intervals for each source. Twelve sources in the catalog are modeled as spatially extended. We provide a detailed comparison of the results from this catalog with those from the first Fermi-LAT catalog (1FGL). Although the diffuse Galactic and isotropic models used in the 2FGL analysis are improved compared to the 1FGL catalog, we attach caution flags to 162 of the sources to indicate possible confusion with residual imperfections in the diffuse model. The 2FGL catalog contains 1873 sources detected and characterized in the 100 MeV to 100 GeV range of which we consider 127 as being firmly identified and 1171 as being reliably associated with counterparts of known or likely $\gamma$-ray-producing source classes. We dedicate this paper to the memory of our colleague Patrick Nolan, who died on 2011 November 6. His career spanned much of the history of high-energy astronomy from space and his work on the Large Area Telescope (LAT) began nearly 20 years ago when it was just a concept.

abstract = {Assuming that supernova shocks accelerate nonthermal particles, we model the temporally evolving nonthermal particle and photon spectra at different stages in the lifetime of a standard shell-type supernova remnant (SNR). A characteristic nu F nu spectrum of an SNR consists of a peak at radio through optical energies from nonthermal electron synchrotron emission and another high-energy gamma-ray peak due primarily to secondary pion production, nonthermal electron bremsstrahlung, and Compton scattering. We find that supernova remnants are capable of producing maximum gamma-ray luminosities >~1035 ergs s-1 if the density of the local interstellar medium is >~10 cm-3. This emission will persist for >~105 yr after the supernova explosion because of the long energy loss timescales for electrons with kinetic energy ~1 GeV. This long gamma-ray lifetime implies that SNRs with a wide range of ages could be gamma-ray sources and could constitute some of the unidentified EGRET sources.},

In this model, the nonthermal electron and proton spectra, and then multiwavelength photon spectra that originated from both the electrons and the protons at different ages of the SNRs, are calculated respectively; the photon spectrum from radio to X-ray bands is dominated by synchrotron radiation of the relativistic electrons, and TeV $\gamma$-rays are produced by electron bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering, and the $\pi$0 decay due to the relativistic protons colliding with ambient medium. Our results indicate that the relative importance of the hadronic origin of TeV $\gamma$-rays depends on the ratio of accelerated electrons to protons at the source, and the hadronic origin of TeV $\gamma$-rays can dominate the bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton processes of the relativistic electrons for young SNRs when a reasonable value of the ratio of the electrons to the protons at the source is used. The model is applied to three young SNRs, RX J1713.7-3946, SN 1006, and RX J0852.0-4622 our model results can explain the multiwavelength photon spectra for the three SNRs and show that the high-energy $\gamma$-rays from RX J1713.7-3946 and RX J0852.0-4622 may have hadronic origins.},

abstract = {The bulk of cosmic rays of up to about 100 TeV are thought to be accelerated by the first-order Fermi mechanism at supernova shocks, producing a power-law spectrum. Both electrons and protons should be accelerated, but their ratio on acceleration is not well known. Recently, the EGRET instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory has observed supernova remnants IC 443 and gamma Cygni at GeV energies. On the assumption that the observed gamma -rays are produced by accelerated particles in the remnants (rather than, for example, from a central compact object), we model the contributions from pion production, bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering on the cosmic microwave, diffuse galactic, and locally produced radiation fields. In the case of the same spectral index for both electrons and nuclei and a cutoff at 80 TeV, we find that a spectral index of accelerated particles that is close to 2.4 and a ratio of electrons to protons in the range 0.2-0.3 give a good fit to the observed spectra. For lower cutoff energies, flatter spectra are possible. We also investigate the case in which the electron spectrum is steeper than that of nuclei. We discuss the implications of our results for observations at air shower energies, and for the propagation of cosmic rays.},

abstract = {The detection of primary cosmic ray electrons with energies above 1 TeV implies the existence of a nearby, r<=100 pc, and relatively young, t<=105 yr, source(s) of accelerated electrons. Therefore a correct treatment of the formation of the spectra of electrons during their propagation in the interstellar medium requires a separate consideration of the contribution of one (or a few) nearby source(s) from the contribution of distant (R>=1 kpc) sources. To implement this approach, the problem of energy-dependent diffusive propagation of relativistic particles from a single source is considered, and the analytical solution to the diffusion equation in the general case of arbitrary energy losses and injection spectrum of primary particles is found. We show that in the framework of the proposed two-component approach, i.e., separating the contribution of the local (discrete) source(s) from the contribution of distant sources, it is possible to explain all the locally observed features of the energy spectrum of cosmic ray electrons from sub-GeV to TeV energies. In addition, assuming that the local source produces electrons and positrons in equal amounts, the model allows us to explain also the reported increase of the positron content in the flux above 10 GeV.},

abstract = {We present a simple analytic model for the various contributions to the non-thermal emission from shell-type SNRs and show that this model's results reproduce well the results of previous detailed calculations. We show that the >=1 TeV gamma ray emission from the shell type SNRs RX J1713.7-3946 and RX J0852.0-4622 is dominated by inverse-Compton scattering of CMB photons (and possibly infrared ambient photons) by accelerated electrons. Pion decay (due to proton-proton collisions) is shown to account for only a small fraction, {\lesssim }10^{-2} , of the observed flux, as assuming a larger fractional contribution would imply non-thermal radio and x-ray synchrotron emission and thermal x-ray bremsstrahlung emission that far exceed the observed radio and x-ray fluxes. Models where pion decay dominates the >=1 TeV flux avoid the implied excessive synchrotron emission (but not the implied excessive thermal x-ray bremsstrahlung emission) by assuming an extremely low efficiency of electron acceleration, K_{\mathrm {ep}}\lesssim 10^{-4} (where Kep is the ratio of the number of accelerated electrons to the number of accelerated protons at a given energy). We argue that observations of SNRs in nearby galaxies imply a lower limit of K_{\mathrm {ep}}\gtrsim 10^{-3} , and thus rule out Kep values {\lesssim } 10^{-4} (assuming that SNRs share a common typical value of Kep). It is suggested that SNRs with strong thermal x-ray emission, rather than strong non-thermal x-ray emission, are more suitable candidates for searches of gamma rays and neutrinos resulting from proton-proton collisions. In particular, it is shown that the neutrino flux from the SNRs above is probably too low to be detected by current and planned neutrino observatories. Finally, we note that the magnetic field value implied by the comparison of x-ray to gamma-ray emission, ~10 µG, can be used to constrain magnetic field amplification.},

When the SNR age is around 105yr, proton acceleration is efficient enough to emit TeV $\gamma$-rays both at the shock of the SNR and that in the GMC. The maximum energy of primarily accelerated electrons is so small that TeV $\gamma$-rays and X-rays are dominated by hadronic processes, $\pi$0-decay and synchrotron radiation from secondary electrons, respectively. However, if the SNR is older than several 105yr, there are few high-energy particles emitting TeV $\gamma$-rays because of the energy-loss effect and/or the wave-damping effect occurring at low-velocity isothermal shocks. For old SNRs or SNR-GMC interacting systems capable of generating TeV $\gamma$-ray emitting particles, we calculated the ratio of TeV $\gamma$-ray (1-10TeV) to X-ray (2-10keV) energy flux and found that it can be more than ~102. Such a source showing large flux ratio may be a possible origin of recently discovered unidentified TeV sources.},

abstract = {Electron acceleration to non-thermal, ultra-relativistic energies (~10-100 TeV) is revealed by radio and X-ray observations of shocks in young supernova remnants (SNRs). The diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism is usually invoked to explain this acceleration, but the way in which electrons are initially energized or "injected" into this acceleration process starting from thermal energies is an unresolved problem. In this paper we study the initial acceleration of electrons in non-relativistic shocks from first principles, using two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. We systematically explore the space of shock parameters (the Alfv{\'e}nic Mach number, MA , the shock velocity, v sh, the angle between the upstream magnetic field and the shock normal, $\theta$ Bn , and the ion to electron mass ratio, mi /me ). We find that significant non-thermal acceleration occurs due to the growth of oblique whistler waves in the foot of quasi-perpendicular shocks. This acceleration strongly depends on using fairly large numerical mass ratios, mi /me , which may explain why it had not been observed in previous PIC simulations of this problem. The obtained electron energy distributions show power-law tails with spectral indices up to $\alpha$ ~ 3-4. The maximum energies of the accelerated particles are consistent with the electron Larmor radii being comparable to that of the ions, indicating potential injection into the subsequent DSA process. This injection mechanism, however, requires the shock waves to have fairly low Alf{\'e}nic Mach numbers, MA <~ 20, which is consistent with the theoretical conditions for the growth of whistler waves in the shock foot (MA <~ (mi /me )1/2). Thus, if the whistler mechanism is the only robust electron injection process at work in SNR shocks, then SNRs that display non-thermal emission must have significantly amplified upstream magnetic fields. Such field amplification is likely achieved by the escaping cosmic rays, so electron and proton acceleration in SNR shocks must be interconnected.},

abstract = {We conduct an analytic and numerical study of the dynamics of supernova remnant (SNR) evolution from the ejecta-dominated stage through the Sedov-Taylor (ST) stage, the stages that precede the onset of dynamically significant radiative losses and/or pressure confinement by the ambient medium. We assume spherical symmetry and focus on the evolution of ejecta described by a power-law density distribution expanding into a uniform ambient medium. We emphasize that all nonradiative remnants of a given power-law structure evolve according to a single unified solution, and we discuss this general property in detail. Use of dimensionless quantities constructed from the characteristic dimensional parameters of the problem-the ejecta energy, ejecta mass, and ambient density-makes the unified nature of the solution manifest. It is also possible to obtain a unified solution for the ST and radiative stages of evolution, and we place our work in the context of scaling laws for solutions for SNR evolution in those stages. We present numerical simulations of the flow and approximate analytic solutions for the motions of both the reverse shock and blast-wave shock. These solutions follow the shocks through the nonradiative stages of remnant evolution across periods of self-similar flow linked by non-self-similar behavior. We elucidate the dependence of the ejecta-dominated evolution on the ejecta power-law index n by developing a general trajectory for all n and explaining its relation to the solutions of Chevalier and Nadyozhin for n>5 and Hamilton {\&} Sarazin for n=0. We demonstrate excellent agreement between our analytic solutions and numerical simulations. These solutions should be valuable in describing remnants such as SN 1006, Tycho, Kepler, Cassiopeia A, and other relatively young SNRs that are between the early ejecta-dominated stage and the late Sedov-Taylor stage. In appendices, we extend our results to power-law ambient media, and we describe an early period of the evolution in which the SNR is radiative and evolves according to a nonunified solution.},

abstract = {A number of supernova remnants (SNRs) show nonthermal X-rays assumed to be synchrotron emission from shock accelerated TeV electrons. The existence of these TeV electrons strongly suggests that the shocks in SNRs are sources of galactic cosmic rays (CRs). In addition, there is convincing evidence from broad-band studies of individual SNRs and elsewhere that the particle acceleration process in SNRs can be efficient and nonlinear. If SNR shocks are efficient particle accelerators, the production of CRs impacts the thermal properties of the shock heated, X-ray emitting gas and the SNR evolution. We report on a technique that couples nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration, including the backreaction of the accelerated particles on the structure of the forward and reverse shocks, with a hydrodynamic simulation of SNR evolution. Compared to models which ignore CRs, the most important hydrodynamical effects of placing a significant fraction of shock energy into CRs are larger shock compression ratios and lower temperatures in the shocked gas. We compare our results, which use an approximate description of the acceleration process, with a more complete model where the full CR transport equations are solved \citep[i.e.,][]{BKV2002}, and find excellent agreement for the CR spectrum summed over the SNR lifetime and the evolving shock compression ratio. The importance of the coupling between particle acceleration and SNR dynamics for the interpretation of broad-band continuum and thermal X-ray observations is discussed.},

abstract = {The strong shocks in young supernova remnants (SNRs) should accelerate cosmic rays (CRs), and there is no doubt that relativistic electrons are produced in SNRs. However, direct and convincing evidence that SNRs produce CR nuclei has not yet been obtained and may, in fact, be long in coming if current $\gamma$-ray observatories do not see an unambiguous pion-decay feature. Nevertheless, the lack of an observed pion-decay feature does not necessarily mean that CR ions are not abundantly produced since ions do not radiate efficiently. If CR ions are produced efficiently by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), their presence will modify the hydrodynamics of the SNR and produce morphological effects that can be clearly seen in radiation produced by electrons. We describe in some detail our CR-hydro model, which couples DSA with the remnant hydrodynamics, and the synchrotron emission expected for two distinct parameter sets representing Type Ia and Type II supernovae. Several morphological features emerge in radial profiles, including the forward shock precursor, which are observable with current X-ray observatories and should definitively show whether young SNRs produce CR ions efficiently or not. For the specific case of SN 1006 we conclude, as have others, that the extremely short X-ray scale heights observed near the outer shock argue convincingly for the efficient production of CR ions.},

These models predict the appearance of multiple solutions, all physically allowed. We discuss here the role of injection in selecting the real solution, in the framework of a simple phenomenological recipe, which is a variation of what is sometimes referred to as thermal leakage. In this context we show that multiple solutions basically disappear and when they are present they are limited to rather peculiar values of the parameters. We also provide a quantitative calculation of the efficiency of particle acceleration at cosmic ray modified shocks and we identify the fraction of energy which is advected downstream and that of particles escaping the system from upstream infinity at the maximum momentum. The consequences of efficient particle acceleration for shock heating are also discussed.},

abstract = {The diffusive shock acceleration process can accelerate particles to a maximum energy depending on the shock speed and age and on any competing loss processes on the particles. The shock waves of young supernova remnants can easily accelerate electrons to energies in excess of 1 TeV, where they can produce X-rays by the synchrotron process. I describe a detailed calculation of the morphology and spectrum of synchrotron X-rays from supernova remnants. Remnants are assumed to be spherical and in the Sedov evolutionary phase, though the results are insensitive to the detailed dynamics. The upstream magnetic field is assumed uniform; downstream it is assumed to be compressed but not additionally turbulently amplified. In all cases, spectra begin to depart from power laws somewhere in the optical to UV range and roll off smoothly through the X-ray band. I show that simple approximations for the electron emissivity are not adequate; a full convolution of the individual electron synchrotron emissivity with a calculated electron distribution at each point in the remnant is required. Models limited by the finite shock age, by synchrotron or inverse Compton losses on electrons, or by escape of electrons above some energy have characteristically different spectral shapes, but within each class, models resemble one another strongly and can be related by simple scalings. The images and spectra depend primarily on the remnant age, the upstream magnetic field strength, and the level of magnetic turbulence near the shock in which the electrons scatter. In addition, images depend on the viewing or aspect angle between the upstream magnetic field and the line of sight. The diffusion coefficient is assumed to be proportional to particle energy (or mean free path proportional to gyroradius), but I investigate the possibility that the proportionality constant becomes much larger above some energy, corresponding to an absence of long-wavelength MHD waves. Models producing similar spectra may differ significantly in morphology, which allows for possible discriminations. I parameterize the model spectra in terms of a slope at 4 keV and a factor by which the X-ray flux density at that energy falls below the extrapolated radio spectrum. Synchrotron radiation may contribute significantly to the X-ray emission of remnants up to several thousand years old.},

abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely believed to be the principal source of Galactic cosmic rays, produced by diffusive shock acceleration in the environs of the remnant's expanding blast wave. Such energetic particles can produce gamma rays and lower energy photons via interactions with the ambient plasma. The recently reported observation of TeV gamma rays from SN 1006 by the Collaboration of Australia and Nippon for a Gamma-Ray Observatory in the Outback (CANGAROO), combined with the fact that several unidentified EGRET sources have been associated with known radio/optical/X-ray-emitting remnants, provides powerful motivation for studying gamma-ray emission from SNRs. In this paper, we present results from a Monte Carlo simulation of nonlinear shock structure and acceleration coupled with photon emission in shelllike SNRs. These nonlinearities are a by-product of the dynamical influence of the accelerated cosmic rays on the shocked plasma and result in distributions of cosmic rays that deviate from pure power laws. Such deviations are crucial to acceleration efficiency considerations and impact photon intensities and spectral shapes at all energies, producing GeV/TeV intensity ratios that are quite different from test particle predictions. The Sedov scaling solution for SNR expansions is used to estimate important shock parameters for input into the Monte Carlo simulation. We calculate ion (proton and helium) and electron distributions that spawn neutral pion decay, bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton, and synchrotron emission, yielding complete photon spectra from radio frequencies to gamma-ray energies. The cessation of acceleration caused by the spatial and temporal limitations of the expanding SNR shell in moderately dense interstellar regions can yield spectral cutoffs in the TeV energy range that are consistent with Whipple's TeV upper limits on those EGRET unidentified sources that have SNR associations. Supernova remnants in lower density environments generate higher energy cosmic rays that produce predominantly inverse Compton emission observable at super-TeV energies, consistent with the SN 1006 detection. In general, sources in such low-density regions will be gamma-ray-dim at GeV energies.},

abstract = {Supernova remnants are beautiful astronomical objects that are also of high scientific interest, because they provide insights into supernova explosion mechanisms, and because they are the likely sources of Galactic cosmic rays. X-ray observations are an important means to study these objects. And in particular the advances made in X-ray imaging spectroscopy over the last two decades has greatly increased our knowledge about supernova remnants. It has made it possible to map the products of fresh nucleosynthesis, and resulted in the identification of regions near shock fronts that emit X-ray synchrotron radiation. Since X-ray synchrotron radiation requires 10--100 TeV electrons, which lose their energies rapidly, the study of X-ray synchrotron radiation has revealed those regions where active and rapid particle acceleration is taking place. In this text all the relevant aspects of X-ray emission from supernova remnants are reviewed and put into the context of supernova explosion properties and the physics and evolution of supernova remnants. The first half of this review has a more tutorial style and discusses the basics of supernova remnant physics and X-ray spectroscopy of the hot plasmas they contain. This includes hydrodynamics, shock heating, thermal conduction, radiation processes, non-equilibrium ionization, He-like ion triplet lines, and cosmic ray acceleration. The second half offers a review of the advances made in field of X-ray spectroscopy of supernova remnants during the last 15 year. This period coincides with the availability of X-ray imaging spectrometers. In addition, I discuss the results of high resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the Chandra and XMM-Newton gratings. Although these instruments are not ideal for studying extended sources, they nevertheless provided interesting results for a limited number of remnants. These results provide a glimpse of what may be achieved with future microcalorimeters that will be available on board future X-ray observatories. In discussing the results of the last 15 years I have chosen to discuss a few topics that are of particular interest. These include the properties of Type Ia supernova remnants, which appear to be regularly shaped and have stratified ejecta, in contrast to core collapse supernova remnants, which have patchy ejecta distributions. For core collapse supernova remnants I discuss the spatial distribution of fresh nucleosynthesis products, but also their properties in connection to the neutron stars they contain. For the mature supernova remnants I focus on the prototypal supernova remnants Vela and the Cygnus Loop. And I discuss the interesting class of mixed-morphology remnants. Many of these mature supernova remnants contain still plasma with enhanced ejecta abundances. Over the last five years it has also become clear that many mixed-morphology remnants contain plasma that is overionized. This is in contrast to most other supernova remnants, which contain underionized plasmas. This text ends with a review of X-ray synchrotron radiation from shock regions, which has made it clear that some form of magnetic-field amplification is operating near shocks, and is an indication of efficient cosmic-ray acceleration.},

abstract = {A comprehensive review is given of the theory and properties of nonrelativistic shocks in hot collisionless plasmas---in view of their possible application in astrophysics. Understanding non-relativistic collisionless shocks is an indispensable step towards a general account of collisionless astrophysical shocks of high Mach number and of their effects in dissipating flow-energy, in heating matter, in accelerating particles to high---presumably cosmic-ray---energies, and in generating detectable radiation from radio to X-rays. Non-relativistic shocks have Alfv{\'e}nic Mach numbers {{fancyscript{M}}_A≪ sqrt{m_i/m_e}($\omega$_{pe}/$\omega$_{ce})}, where m i / m e is the ion-to-electron mass ratio, and $\omega$ pe , $\omega$ ce are the electron plasma and cyclotron frequencies, respectively. Though high, the temperatures of such shocks are limited (in energy units) to T < m e c 2. This means that particle creation is inhibited, classical theory is applicable, and reaction of radiation on the dynamics of the shock can be neglected. The majority of such shocks are supercritical, meaning that non-relativistic shocks are unable to self-consistently produce sufficient dissipation and, thus, to sustain a stationary shock transition. As a consequence, supercritical shocks act as efficient particle reflectors. All these shocks are microscopically thin, with shock-transition width of the order of the ion inertial length $\lambda$ i = c/ $\omega$ pi (with $\omega$ pi the ion plasma frequency). The full theory of such shocks is developed, and the different possible types of shocks are defined. Since all collisionless shocks are magnetised, the most important distinction is between quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel shocks. The former propagate about perpendicularly, the latter roughly parallel to the upstream magnetic field. Their manifestly different behaviours are described in detail. In particular, although both types of shocks are non-stationary, they have completely different reformation cycles. From numerical full-particle simulations it becomes evident that, on ion-inertial scales close to the shock transition, all quasi-parallel collisionless supercritical shocks are locally quasi-perpendicular. This property is of vital importance for the particle dynamics near the quasi-parallel shock front. Considerable interest focusses on particle acceleration and the generation of radiation. Radiation from non-relativistic shocks results mainly in wave-wave interactions among various plasma waves. Non-thermal charged particles can be further accelerated to high energies by a Fermi-like mechanism. The important question is whether the shock can pre-accelerate shock-reflected particles to sufficiently high energies in order to create the seed-population of the non-thermal particles required by the Fermi mechanism. Based on preliminary full-particle numerical simulations, this question is answered affirmatively. Such simulations provide ample evidence that collisionless shocks with high-Mach numbers---even when non-relativistic---could probably by themselves produce the energetic seed-particle population for the Fermi-process.},

It is expressed that collisionless shocks as a realistic possibility of a state of matter have been realized not earlier than roughly half a centruy ago. The basic properties of collisionless shocks are noted in preparing the theory of collisionless shocks and a classification of shocks is given in terms of their physical properties, which is developed in the following chapters. The structure of this chapter is as follows: 1. A cursory historical overview, describing the early history, gasdynamic shocks, the realisation of the existence of collisionless shocks and their investigation over three decades in theory and observation until the numerical simulation age, 2. Posing the shock problem as the question: When are shocks? 3. Types of collisionless shocks, describing electrostatic shocks, magnetized shocks, MHD shocks, shock evolutionarity and coplanarity, switch-on and switch-off shocks, 4. Criticality, describing the transition from subcritical dissipative to supercritical viscose shocks, 5. Remarks.},

These energies are limited by several bounds: the non-relativistic nature of the heliospheric collisionless shocks to which this review restricts, the finite size of these shocks, the finite width of the downstream region, and to the nature of turbulence. In general, collisionless shocks in the heliosphere cannot accelerate particles to very high energies.

Acceleration of electrons begins to uncover its nature. The following problems are covered in this chapter: 1. Introduction -- first and second order Fermi acceleration, 2.

abstract = {In this concise review of the recent developments in relativistic shock theory in the Universe we restrict ourselves to shocks that do not exhibit quantum effects. On the other hand, emphasis is given to the formation of shocks under both non-magnetised and magnetised conditions. We only briefly discuss particle acceleration in relativistic shocks where much of the results are still preliminary. Analytical theory is rather limited in predicting the real shock structure. Kinetic instability theory is briefed including its predictions and limitations. A recent self-similar relativistic shock theory is described which predicts the average long-term shock behaviour to be magnetised and to cause reasonable power-law distributions for energetic particles. The main focus in this review is on numerical experiments on highly relativistic shocks in (i) pair and (ii) electron-nucleon plasmas and their limitations. These simulations do not validate all predictions of analytic and self-similar theory and so far they do not solve the injection problem and the self-modification by self-generated cosmic rays. The main results of the numerical experiments discussed in this review are: (i) a confirmation of shock evolution in non-magnetised relativistic plasma in 3D due to either the lepton-Weibel instability (in pair plasmas) or to the ion-Weibel instability; (ii) the sensitive dependence of shock formation on upstream magnetisation which causes suppression of Weibel modes for large upstream magnetisation ratios $\sigma$>10-3; (iii) the sensitive dependence of particle dynamics on the upstream magnetic inclination angle $\theta$ Bn , where particles of $\theta$ Bn >34$\,^{\circ}$ cannot escape upstream, leading to the distinction between `subluminal' and `superluminal' shocks; (iv) particles in ultra-relativistic shocks can hardly overturn the shock and escape to upstream; they may oscillate around the shock ramp for a long time, so to speak `surfing it' and thereby becoming accelerated by a kind of SDA; (v) these particles form a power-law tail on the downstream distribution; their limitations are pointed out; (vi) recently developed methods permit the calculation of the radiation spectra emitted by the downstream high-energy particles; (vii) the Weibel-generated downstream magnetic fields form large-amplitude vortices which could be advected by the downstream flow to large distances from the shock and possibly contribute to an extended strong field region; (viii) if cosmic rays are included, Bell-like modes can generate upstream magnetic turbulence at short and, by diffusive re-coupling, also long wavelengths in nearly parallel magnetic field shocks; (ix) advection of such large-amplitude waves should cause periodic reformation of the quasi-parallel shock and eject large-amplitude magnetic field vortices downstream where they contribute to turbulence and to maintaining an extended region of large magnetic fields.},

abstract = {Among the various acceleration mechanisms which have been suggested as responsible for the nonthermal particle spectra and associated radiation observed in many astrophysical and space physics environments, diffusive shock acceleration appears to be the most successful. We review the current theoretical understanding of this process, from the basic ideas of how a shock energizes a few reactionless particles to the advanced nonlinear approaches treating the shock and accelerated particles as a symbiotic self-organizing system. By means of direct solution of the nonlinear problem we set the limit to the test-particle approximation and demonstrate the fundamental role of nonlinearity in shocks of astrophysical size and lifetime. We study the bifurcation of this system, proceeding from the hydrodynamic to kinetic description under a realistic condition of Bohm diffusivity. We emphasize the importance of collective plasma phenomena for the global flow structure and acceleration efficiency by considering the injection process, an initial stage of acceleration and, the related aspects of the physics of collisionless shocks. We calculate the injection rate for different shock parameters and different species. This, together with differential acceleration resulting from nonlinear large-scale modification, determines the chemical composition of accelerated particles. The review concentrates on theoretical and analytical aspects but our strategic goal is to link the fundamental theoretical ideas with the rapidly growing wealth of observational data.},

abstract = {To better model the efficient production of cosmic rays (CRs) in supernova remnants (SNRs) with the associated coupling between CR production and SNR dynamics, we have generalized an existing cr-hydro-NEI code (i.e., Ellison et al. 2012) to include the following processes: (1) an explicit calculation of the upstream precursor structure including the position dependent flow speed, density, temperature, and magnetic field strength; (2) a momentum and space dependent CR diffusion coefficient; (3) an explicit calculation of magnetic field amplification (MFA); (4) calculation of the maximum CR momentum using the amplified magnetic field; (5) a finite Alfven speed for the particle scattering centers; and (6) the ability to accelerate a superthermal seed population of CRs as well as the ambient thermal plasma. While a great deal of work has been done modeling SNRs, most work has concentrated on either the continuum emission from relativistic electrons or ions, or the thermal emission from the shock heated plasma. Our generalized code combines these elements and describes the interplay between CR production and SNR evolution, including the nonlinear coupling of efficient diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), based mainly on the work of P. Blasi and co-workers, and a non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) calculation of thermal X-ray line emission. We believe our generalized model will provide a consistent modeling platform for SNRs, including those interacting with molecular clouds, and improve the interpretation of current and future observations, including the high-quality spectra expected from Astro-H. SNR RX J1713.7-3946 is modeled as an example.},

abstract = {Recent observations reveal that spectral breaks at ˜GeV are commonly present in Galactic $\gamma$-ray supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds and that most of them have a spectral (E2dF/dE) 'platform' extending from the break to lower energies. In Paper I, we developed an accumulative diffusion model by considering an accumulation of the diffusive protons escaping from the shock front throughout the history of the SNR expansion. In this paper, we improve the model by incorporating the finite volume of molecular clouds, demonstrate the model dependence on particle diffusion parameters and cloud size, and apply it to nine interacting SNRs (W28, W41, W44, W49B, W51C, Cygnus Loop, IC443, CTB 37A and G349.7+0.2). This refined model naturally explains the GeV spectral breaks and, in particular, the 'platforms', together with available TeV data. We find that the index of the diffusion coefficient $\delta$ is in the range 0.5-0.7, similar to the Galactic averaged value, and the diffusion coefficient for cosmic rays around the SNRs is essentially two orders of magnitude lower than the Galactic average ($\chi$˜ 0.01), which is a good indication for the suppression of cosmic-ray diffusion near SNRs.},

abstract = {We report the detection of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission from the molecular cloud complex that surrounds the supernova remnant (SNR) W44 using the Large Area Telescope on board Fermi. While the previously reported $\gamma$-ray emission from SNR W44 is likely to arise from the dense radio-emitting filaments within the remnant, the $\gamma$-ray emission that appears to come from the surrounding molecular cloud complex can be ascribed to the cosmic rays (CRs) that have escaped from W44. The non-detection of synchrotron radio emission associated with the molecular cloud complex suggests the decay of $\pi$0 mesons produced in hadronic collisions as the $\gamma$-ray emission mechanism. The total kinetic energy channeled into the escaping CRs is estimated to be W esc ~ (0.3-3) × 1050 erg, in broad agreement with the conjecture that SNRs are the main sources of Galactic CRs.},

The brightness distribution and X-ray spectrum of the SNR are obtained from archival ROSAT and ASCA X-ray data. The X-ray image of G78.2+2.1 exhibits a shell structure (deltaR/R = 0.3) and is generally similar to its radio image; a comparison with the radio map at 1.4 GHz constructed from archival VLA data reveals the coincidence of features on scales of several arcminutes at the eastern boundary of G78.2+2.1. Weak X-ray emission (an outer shell or a halo of size approximately equal to 2 deg) has been identified for the first time far outside G78.2+2.1. The X-ray emission from G78.2+2.1 is shown to characterize a young adiabatic SNR [M_{X-ray} = 100 M_solar, V_s = 10^3 km/s, t = (5-6) x 10^3 years], which probably expands inside the cavity swept up by the progenitor's stellar wind. Searches for the corresponding radio structure are required to elucidate the nature of the outer X-ray shell or halo.},

abstract = {The wide-field covered by the supernova remnant G 78.2+2.1 was observed in the optical emission lines of H$\alpha$+[N II] S II and O III. The flux calibrated images reveal several H II regions in the field which dominate the optical emission but we were able to identify possible areas of shock-heated emission through the H$\alpha$+[N II] and S II images. These are mainly found to the north-east of gamma Cygni as well as in the south and the morphology of the detected emission is patchy and diffuse. A few patchy structures are also detected in the medium ionization line image of [O III]. Long-slit spectra taken at one of the candidate positions verify that we have detected radiation from shock-heated gas (S II/H$\alpha$ ˜= 0.6). The estimated shock velocity lies below 100 km s-1, while the measured electron density of ˜700 cm-3 implies preshock cloud densities of ˜ 20 cm-3. High resolution maps in the infrared show that the optical emission, which may be associated with G 78.2+2.1, lies in areas relatively free of infrared emission. The interstellar extinction measured through the optical spectra is compatible with current estimates of the distance to the remnant. The optical data are in agreement with the explosion energy and interstellar medium density estimated from the X-ray data suggesting that the remnant is still in the adiabatic phase of its evolution. A second set of spectra taken in the north-west suggests that we are probably dealing with a foreground H II region.},

abstract = {Molecular clouds are expected to emit non-thermal radiation due to cosmic ray interactions in the dense magnetized gas. Such emission is amplified if a cloud is located close to an accelerator of cosmic rays and if energetic particles can leave the accelerator site and diffusively reach the cloud. We consider here a situation in which a molecular cloud is located in the proximity of a supernova remnant which is efficiently accelerating cosmic rays and gradually releasing them in the interstellar medium. We calculate the multiwavelength spectrum from radio to gamma rays which is emerging from the cloud as the result of cosmic ray interactions. The total energy output is dominated by the gamma-ray emission, which can exceed the emission in other bands by an order of magnitude or more. This suggests that some of the unidentified TeV sources detected so far, with no obvious or very weak counterparts in other wavelengths, might be in fact associated with clouds illuminated by cosmic rays coming from a nearby source. Moreover, under certain conditions, the gamma-ray spectrum exhibits a concave shape, being steep at low energies and hard at high energies. This fact might have important implications for the studies of the spectral compatibility of GeV and TeV gamma-ray sources.},

abstract = {Recently, the gamma-ray telescopes AGILE and Fermi observed several middle-aged supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds. It is likely that their gamma-rays arise from the decay of neutral pions produced by the inelastic collision between cosmic rays (CRs) and nucleons, which suggests that SNRs make the bulk of Galactic CRs. In this paper, we provide the analytical solution of the distribution of CRs that have escaped from a finite-size region, which naturally explains observed broken power-law spectra of the middle-aged SNRs. In addition, the typical value of the break energy of the gamma-ray spectrum, 1-10 GeV, is naturally explained from the fact that the stellar wind dynamics shows a separation between the molecular clouds and the explosion centre of about 10 pc. We find that the runaway-CR spectrum of the four middle-aged SNRs (W51C, W28, W44 and IC 443) interacting with molecular clouds could be the same, even though it leads to different gamma-ray spectra. This result is consistent with that of recent studies of Galactic CR propagation, and supports that SNRs are indeed the sources of Galactic CRs.},

abstract = {Diffusive shock acceleration operating at expanding supernova remnant shells is by far the most popular model for the origin of galactic cosmic rays. Despite the general consensus received by this model, an unambiguous and conclusive proof of the supernova remnant hypothesis is still missing. In this context, the recent developments in gamma ray astronomy provide us with precious insights into the problem of the origin of galactic cosmic rays, since production of gamma rays is expected both during the acceleration of cosmic rays at supernova remnant shocks and during their subsequent propagation in the interstellar medium. In particular, the recent detection of a number of supernova remnants at TeV energies nicely fits with the model, but it still does not constitute a conclusive proof of it, mainly due to the difficulty of disentangling the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the observed gamma ray emission. In this paper, the most relevant cosmic-ray-related results of gamma ray astronomy are briefly summarized, and the foreseeable contribution of future gamma ray observations to the final solution of the problem of cosmic ray origin is discussed.},

abstract = {We present a model of gamma-ray emission from core-collapse supernovae (SNe) originating from the explosions of massive young stars. The fast forward shock of the supernova remnant (SNR) can accelerate particles by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in a cavern blown by a strong, pre-SN stellar wind. As a fundamental part of nonlinear DSA, some fraction of the accelerated particles escape the shock and interact with a surrounding massive dense shell producing hard photon emission. To calculate this emission, we have developed a new Monte Carlo technique for propagating the cosmic rays (CRs) produced by the forward shock of the SNR, into the dense, external material. This technique is incorporated in a hydrodynamic model of an evolving SNR which includes the nonlinear feedback of CRs on the SNR evolution, the production of escaping CRs along with those that remain trapped within the remnant, and the broadband emission of radiation from trapped and escaping CRs. While our combined CR-hydro-escape model is quite general and applies to both core collapse and thermonuclear SNe, the parameters we choose for our discussion here are more typical of SNRs from very massive stars whose emission spectra differ somewhat from those produced by lower mass progenitors directly interacting with a molecular cloud.},

Such emission correlates quite well with the position of dense and massive molecular clouds and thus it is often interpreted as the result of hadronic cosmic ray interactions in the dense gas. Constraints on the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient in the region can be obtained, under the assumption that the cosmic rays responsible for the gamma ray emission have been accelerated in the past at the supernova remnant shock, and subsequently escaped in the surrounding medium. In this scenario, gamma ray observations can be explained only if the diffusion coefficient in the region surrounding the supernova remnant is significantly suppressed with respect to the average galactic one.},

Cosmic rays escaping from supernova remnants diffuse into the interstellar medium and collide with the ambient atomic and molecular gas. From such collisions gamma-rays are created, which can possibly provide the first evidence of a parent population of runaway cosmic rays. We present model predictions for the GeV to TeV gamma-ray emission produced by the collisions of runaway cosmic rays with the gas in the surroundings of the shell-type supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946. The spectral and spatial distributions of the emission, which depend upon the source age, the source injection history, the diffusion regime, and the distribution of the ambient gas, as mapped by the LAB and NANTEN surveys, are studied in detail. For the surrounding region of RX J1713-3946 in particular, we find out that it depends on the energy band one is observing whether one may observe startlingly different spectra or may not detect any enhanced emission with respect to the diffuse emission contributed by background cosmic rays. This result has important implications for current and future gamma-ray experiments.},

We then introduce a methodology which aims to provide a test bed for current and future $\gamma$-ray observatories to explore the cosmic-ray flux at various positions in our Galaxy. In particular, for a distribution of molecular clouds, as provided by the NANTEN survey, and local cosmic-ray density as measured at the Earth, we estimate the expected GeV to TeV $\gamma$-ray signal, which can then be compared with observations, and use to test the cosmic-ray flux.},

abstract = {Context. The spectrum of cosmic rays (CRs) is affected by their escape from an acceleration site. This may be observed not only in the gamma-ray spectrum of young supernova remnants (SNRs) such as RX J1713.7-3946, but also in the spectrum of CRs showering the Earth. Aims: The escape-limited model of cosmic-ray acceleration is studied in general. We discuss the spectrum of runaway CRs from the acceleration site. The model will also be able to constrain the spectral index at the acceleration site and the ansatz with respect to the unknown injection process into the particle acceleration. Methods: Our methods are analytical derivations. We apply our model to CR acceleration in SNRs and in active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are plausible candidates of Galactic and extragalactic CRs, respectively. In particular we take account into the shock evolution with cooling of escaping CRs in the Sedov phase for young SNRs. Results: The spectrum of escaping CRs generally depends on the physical quantities at the acceleration site like the spectral index, the evolution of the maximum energy of CRs and the evolution of the normalization factor of the spectrum. It is found that the spectrum of runaway particles can be both softer and harder than that of the acceleration site. Conclusions: The model explains spectral indices of both Galactic and extragalactic CRs produced by SNRs and AGNs, respectively, suggesting the unified picture of CR acceleration.},

abstract = {The cosmic-ray streaming instability creates strong magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the precursor of a SN shock. The level of turbulence determines the maximum energy of cosmic-ray particles accelerated by the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism. In this paper we present the continuation of previous work (Ptuskin {\&} Zirakashvili 2003). We assume that Kolmogorov type nonlinear wave interactions together with ion-neutral collisions restrict the amplitude of the random magnetic field. As a result, the maximum energy of the accelerated particles strongly depends on the age of a SNR. The average spectrum of cosmic rays injected in the interstellar medium in the course of the adiabatic SNR evolution (the Sedov stage) is approximately Q(p)p2∝ p-2 at energies larger than 10-30 GeV/nucleon and with a maximum particle energy that is close to the position of the knee in the cosmic-ray spectrum observed at ˜4×1015 eV. At an earlier stage of SNR evolution - the ejecta-dominated stage described by the Chevalier-Nadyozhin solution, the particles are accelerated to higher energies and have a rather steep power-law distribution. These results suggest that the knee may mark the transition from the ejecta-dominated to the adiabatic evolution of SNR shocks which accelerate cosmic rays.},

abstract = {The recent H.E.S.S. detections of supernova remnant shells in TeV $\gamma$-rays confirm the theoretical predictions that supernova remnants can operate as powerful cosmic-ray accelerators. If these objects are responsible for the bulk of galactic cosmic rays, then they should accelerate protons and nuclei to 1015 eV and beyond, i.e., act as cosmic PeVatrons. The model of diffusive shock acceleration allows, under certain conditions, acceleration of particles to such high energies and their gradual injection into the interstellar medium, mainly during the Sedov phase of the remnant evolution. The most energetic particles are released first, while particles of lower energies are more effectively confined in the shell and are released at later epochs. Thus, the spectrum of nonthermal particles inside the shell extends to PeV energies only during a relatively short period of the evolution of the remnant. For this reason, one may expect spectra of secondary $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos extending to energies beyond 10 TeV only from T<~1000 yr old supernova remnants. On the other hand, if by chance a massive gas cloud appears in the <~100 pc vicinity of the supernova remnant, ``delayed'' multi-TeV signals of $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos arise when the most energetic particles that emerged from the supernova shell reach the cloud. The detection of such delayed emission of multi-TeV $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos allows indirect identification of the supernova remnant as a particle PeVatron.},

abstract = {The recent galactic plane surveys with space- and ground-based detectors revealed a number of high and very-high energy $\gamma$-ray sources associated with young and middle-aged supernova remnants (SNRs). These results imply effective production of relativistic particles, most likely through the process of diffusive shock acceleration. The interpretation of $\gamma$-ray data from several prominent representatives of young SNRs within the so-called 'hadronic models' demands hard proton spectra extending to 100 TeV, and total energy released in accelerated protons and ions WCR⩾1050 erg. This can be treated as a support of the SNR paradigm of galactic cosmic rays. However, the hadronic models are not free of pitfalls, and pose in fact non-trivial challenges. Moreover, in many cases $\gamma$-ray data can be successfully explained also by the inverse Compton scattering of directly accelerated electrons. Future deep spectroscopic and morphological studies of SNRs with the planned Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) over four decades in energy, from approximately 30 GeV to 300 TeV, promise a breakthrough regarding the identification of radiation mechanisms. The extension of studies beyond the shells of SNRs will be another important objective aimed at the extraction of information about the highest energy particles which have left remnants at the early epochs of their evolution. These particles, which potentially carry an answer to a key question whether SNRs operate as PeVatrons, can be traced via $\gamma$-ray emission outside the remnants. Finally, the expected significant increase of the number of $\gamma$-ray emitting SNRs by CTA should allow compelling population studies -- a key issue for the proof of the SNR origin of galactic cosmic rays.},

abstract = {Supernova remnants are believed to be the major contributors to Galactic cosmic rays. In this paper, we explore how the non-thermal emission from young remnants can be used to probe the production of energetic particles at the shock (both protons and electrons). Our model couples hydrodynamic simulations of a supernova remnant with a kinetic treatment of particle acceleration. We include two important back-reaction loops upstream of the shock: energetic particles can (i) modify the flow structure and (ii) amplify the magnetic field. As the latter process is not fully understood, we use different limit cases that encompass a wide range of possibilities. We follow the history of the shock dynamics and of the particle transport downstream of the shock, which allows us to compute the non-thermal emission from the remnant at any given age. We do this in 3D, in order to generate projected maps that can be compared with observations. We observe that completely different recipes for the magnetic field can lead to similar modifications of the shock structure, although to very different configurations of the field and particles. We show how this affects the emission patterns in different energy bands, from radio to X-rays and $\gamma$-rays. High magnetic fields ($>100 \mu$G) directly impact the synchrotron emission from electrons, by restricting their emission to thin rims, and indirectly impact the inverse Compton emission from electrons and also the pion decay emission from protons, mostly by shifting their cut-off energies to respectively lower and higher energies.},

Enhanced OH abundance created by the passing shock is observed both as maser emission and absorption against the strong background of the remnant. Modeling the observed OH profiles gives an estimate of the physical conditions in which weak, extended maser emission arises.

Two SNRs, G5.7-0.0 and G8.7-0.1, have TeV $\gamma$-ray counterparts which may indicate a local cosmic ray enhancement. It has been noted that maser-emitting (ME) SNRs are preferentially distributed in the molecular ring and nuclear disk. We use the present and existing surveys to demonstrate that masers are strongly confined to within |l| <= 50$\,^{\circ}$ at a rate of 15% of the total SNR population. All new detections are within 10$\,^{\circ}$ Galactic longitude emphasizing this trend. Additionally, a substantial number of SNR masers have peak fluxes at or below the detection threshold of existing surveys. This calls into question whether maser surveys of Galactic SNRs can be considered complete and how many ME remnants remain to be detected in the Galaxy.},

We find the excitation of H2 S(0)-S(7) lines in these SNRs requires two nondissociative shock components: a slow 10 km s-1 C-shock through clumps of density 106 cm-3, and a faster 40-70 km s-1 C-shock through a medium of density 104 cm-3. The ortho-to-para ratio for H2 in the warm shocked gas is typically found to be much less than the LTE value, suggesting that these SNRs are propagating into cold quiescent clouds. Additionally, a total of 13 atomic fine-structure transitions of Ar+, Ar++, Fe+, Ne+, Ne++, S++, and Si+ are detected. The ionic emitting regions are spatially segregated from the molecular emitting regions within the IRS slits. The presence of ionic lines with high appearance potential requires the presence of much faster, dissociative shocks through a lower density medium. The IRS slits are sufficiently wide to include regions outside the SNR which permits emission from diffuse gas around the remnants to be separated from the shocked emission. We find the diffuse H2 gas projected outside the SNR is excited to a temperature of 100-300 K with a warm gas fraction of at least 0.5%-15% along the line of sight.},

abstract = {3C 397 is a radio and X-ray bright Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) with an unusual rectangular morphology. Our CO observation obtained with the Purple Mountain Observatory at Delingha reveals that the remnant is well confined in a cavity of molecular gas, and embedded at the edge of a molecular cloud (MC) at the local standard of rest systemic velocity of ~32 km/s. The cloud has a column density gradient increasing from southeast to northwest, perpendicular to the Galactic plane, in agreement with the elongation direction of the remnant. This systemic velocity places the cloud and SNR 3C 397 at a kinematic distance of ~10.3 kpc. The derived mean molecular density (~10-30 cm^-3) explains the high volume emission measure of the X-ray emitting gas. A 12CO line broadening of the ~32 km/s component is detected at the westmost boundary of the remnant, which provides direct evidence of the SNR-MC interaction and suggests multi-component gas there with dense (~10^4 cm^-3) molecular clumps. We confirm the previous detection of a MC at ~38 km/s to the west and south of the SNR and argue, based on HI self-absorption, that the cloud is located in the foreground of the remnant. A list of Galactic SNRs presently known and suggested to be in physical contact with environmental MCs is appended in this paper.},

abstract = {A group of middle-aged mixed-morphology (MM) supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds (MC) has been discovered as strong GeV gamma-ray emitters by Large Area Telescope on board Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope (Fermi-LAT). The recent observations of the Suzaku X-ray satellite have revealed that some of these interacting gamma-ray emitting SNRs, such as IC443, W49B, W44, and G359.1-0.5, have overionized plasmas. 3C 391 (G31.9+0.0) is another Galactic MM SNR interacting with MC. It was observed in GeV gamma rays by Fermi-LAT as well as in the 0.3 $-$ 10.0 keV X-ray band by Suzaku. In this work, 3C 391 was detected in GeV gamma rays with a significance of $\sim$ 18 $\sigma$ and we showed that the GeV emission is point-like in nature. The GeV gamma-ray spectrum was shown to be best explained by the decay of neutral pions assuming that the protons follow a broken power-law distribution. We revealed radiative recombination structures of silicon and sulfur from 3C 391 using Suzaku data. In this paper we discuss the possible origin of this type of radiative plasma and hadronic gamma rays.},

abstract = {For decades researchers have studied the On/Off counting problem, where a measured rate consists of two parts. One due to a signal process and another due to a background process, of which both magnitudes are unknown. While most frequentist methods are adequate for large count numbers, they cannot be applied to sparse data. Here I want to present a new objective Bayesian solution that only depends on three parameters: the number of events in the signal region, the number of events in the background region, and the ratio of the exposure for both regions. First, the probability of the hypothesis that the counts are due to background only is derived analytically. Second, the marginalized posterior for the signal parameter is also derived analytically. With this two-step approach it is easy to calculate the signal's significance, strength, uncertainty, or upper limit in a unified way. The approach is valid without restrictions for any count number including zero and may be widely applied in particle physics, cosmic-ray physics and high-energy astrophysics. In order to demonstrate its performance I apply the method to gamma-ray burst data.},

abstract = {The giant molecular clouds (MCs) found in the Milky Way and similar galaxies play a crucial role in the evolution of these systems. The supernova explosions that mark the death of massive stars in these regions often lead to interactions between the supernova remnants (SNRs) and the clouds. These interactions have a profound effect on our understanding of SNRs. Shocks in SNRs should be capable of accelerating particles to cosmic ray (CR) energies with efficiencies high enough to power Galactic CRs. X-ray and gamma-ray studies have established the presence of relativistic electrons and protons is some SNRs and provided strong evidence for diffusive shock acceleration as the primary acceleration mechanism, including strongly amplified magnetic fields, temperature and ionization effects on the shock-heated plasmas, and modifications to the dynamical evolution of some systems. Because protons dominate the overall energetics of the CRs, it is crucial to understand this hadronic component even though electrons are much more efficient radiators and it can be difficult to identify the hadronic component. However, near MCs the densities are sufficiently high to allow the gamma-ray emission to be dominated by protons. Thus, these interaction sites provide some of our best opportunities to constrain the overall energetics of these particle accelerators. Here we summarize some key properties of interactions between SNRs and MCs, with an emphasis on recent X-ray and gamma-ray studies that are providing important constraints on our understanding of cosmic rays in our Galaxy.},

CR advection, energy dependent anisotropic diffusion with respect to the magnetic field and adiabatic losses to follow the evolution of spectra are taken into account. We present a first study of the transport and immediate (~150 kyr) dynamical impact of CRs on the turbulent magnetised interstellar medium around supernova remnants on scales up to 80 pc. CR diffusion quickly leads to an efficient acceleration of low-density gas (mainly perpendicular to the magnetic field) with accelerations up to two orders of magnitude above the thermal values. Peaked (at 1 GeV) CR injection spectra have a stronger impact on the dynamics than power-law spectra. For realistic magnetic field configurations low energy CRs (with smaller diffusion coefficients) distribute anisotropically with large spatial variations of a factor of ten and more. Adiabatic losses can change the local spectra perceptibly but do not have an integral effect on the dynamics at the spatial and temporal scales considered here. We discuss the potential global impact of CRs and anisotropic transport on the dynamical structure of the ISM and also detail the limitations of the model.},

A new H I absorption spectrum towards the core of CTB80 yields a kinematic distance of ≃1.5 kpc. An analysis of the H I channel maps confirms the inner shell discovered by Koo et al. In addition, we discover an outer slowly moving shell centred on CTB80's centre, with radius 76 arcmin and velocity 40 km s-1. The shell's size and velocity are inconsistent with a stellar wind origin, but are consistent with what is expected for a cool dense shell in the cooling (snowplough) phase of a supernova remnant. Taking into account deceleration of the shell, its age also agrees with that of CTB80 (˜60 000 yr). The resulting picture of CTB80 is that of a large old supernova remnant, with an H I shell moving out slowly behind the slow outer shock and a hot interior which is still emitting X-rays and visible in the ROSAT images.},

abstract = {The physical properties of molecular clouds are often measured using spectral-line observations, which provide the only probes of the clouds' velocity structure. It is hard, though, to assess whether and to what extent intensity features in position-position-velocity (PPV) space correspond to "real" density structures in position-position-position (PPP) space. In this paper, we create synthetic molecular cloud spectral-line maps of simulated molecular clouds, and present a new technique for measuring the reality of individual PPV structures. Using a dendrogram algorithm, we identify hierarchical structures in both PPP and PPV space. Our procedure projects density structures identified in PPP space into corresponding intensity structures in PPV space and then measures the geometric overlap of the projected structures with structures identified from the synthetic observation. The fractional overlap between a PPP and PPV structure quantifies how well the synthetic observation recovers information about the three-dimensional structure. Applying this machinery to a set of synthetic observations of CO isotopes, we measure how well spectral-line measurements recover mass, size, velocity dispersion, and virial parameter for a simulated star-forming region. By disabling various steps of our analysis, we investigate how much opacity, chemistry, and gravity affect measurements of physical properties extracted from PPV cubes. For the simulations used here, which offer a decent, but not perfect, match to the properties of a star-forming region like Perseus, our results suggest that superposition induces a ~40% uncertainty in masses, sizes, and velocity dispersions derived from 13CO (J = 1-0). As would be expected, superposition and confusion is worst in regions where the filling factor of emitting material is large. The virial parameter is most affected by superposition, such that estimates of the virial parameter derived from PPV and PPP information typically disagree by a factor of ~2. This uncertainty makes it particularly difficult to judge whether gravitational or kinetic energy dominate a given region, since the majority of virial parameter measurements fall within a factor of two of the equipartition level $\alpha$ ~ 2.},

abstract = {We present the analysis of Fermi Large Area Telescope $\gamma$-ray observations of HB 21 (G89.0+4.7). We detect significant $\gamma$-ray emission associated with the remnant: the flux >100 MeV is 9.4 $\pm$ 0.8 (stat) $\pm$ 1.6 (syst) × 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1. HB 21 is well modeled by a uniform disk centered at l = 88.$\,^{\circ}$75 $\pm$ 0.$\,^{\circ}$04, b = +4.$\,^{\circ}$65 $\pm$ 0.$\,^{\circ}$06 with a radius of 1.$\,^{\circ}$19 $\pm$ 0.$\,^{\circ}$06. The $\gamma$-ray spectrum shows clear evidence of curvature, suggesting a cutoff or break in the underlying particle population at an energy of a few GeV. We complement $\gamma$-ray observations with the analysis of the WMAP 7 yr data from 23 to 93 GHz, achieving the first detection of HB 21 at these frequencies. In combination with archival radio data, the radio spectrum shows a spectral break, which helps to constrain the relativistic electron spectrum, and, in turn, parameters of simple non-thermal radiation models. In one-zone models multiwavelength data favor the origin of $\gamma$ rays from nucleon-nucleon collisions. A single population of electrons cannot produce both $\gamma$ rays through bremsstrahlung and radio emission through synchrotron radiation. A predominantly inverse-Compton origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission is disfavored because it requires lower interstellar densities than are inferred for HB 21. In the hadronic-dominated scenarios, accelerated nuclei contribute a total energy of ~3 × 1049 erg, while, in a two-zone bremsstrahlung-dominated scenario, the total energy in accelerated particles is ~1 × 1049 erg.},

abstract = {Initial discovery of CRs dates back to a century ago (1912). Their identification as particles rather than radiation dates to about 20 years later and in 20 more years also the first suggestion that they were associated with SNRs was in place. The basic mechanism behind their acceleration was suggested almost 40 years ago. Much work has been done since then to the aim of proving that both the acceleration mechanism and site are well understood, but no definite proof has been obtained: in spite of impressive progress of both theory and observations, the evidence in support of the commonly accepted interpretation is only circumstantial. In the following I will try to make the point on where we stand in terms of how our theories confront with data: I will review recent progress on the subject and try to point to avenues to pursue in order to gather new proofs, if not smoking gun evidence of the origin of Galactic Cosmic Rays.

abstract = {Previous observations with HESS have revealed the existence of an extended very-high-energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) gamma-ray source, HESS J1834-087, coincident with the SNR W41. The origin of the gamma-ray emission has been further investigated with HESS and the Fermi-LAT. The gamma-ray data provided by 61h (HESS) and 4 yrs (Fermi LAT) of observations cover over 5 decades in energy (1.8GeV - 30TeV). The morphology and spectrum of the TeV and GeV sources have been studied and multi-wavelength data have been used to investigate the origin of the observed emission. The TeV source can be modeled with a sum of two components: one point-like and one significantly extended (sig_TeV = 0.17{\deg}), both centered on SNR W41 and exhibiting spectra described by a power law of index 2.6. The GeV source detected with Fermi is extended (sig_GeV =0.15{\deg}) and morphologically matches the VHE emission. Its spectrum can be described by a power-law with index 2.15 and joins smoothly the one of the whole TeV source. A break appears in the spectra around 100 GeV. Two main scenarios are proposed to explain the emission: a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or the interaction of SNR W41 with a molecular cloud. X-ray observations suggest the presence of a point-like source (pulsar candidate) near the center of the SNR and non-thermal X-ray diffuse emission which could arise from a potential PWN. The PWN scenario is supported by the match of of the TeV and GeV positions with the putative pulsar. However, the overall spectrum is reproduced by a 1-zone leptonic model only if an excess of low-energy electrons is injected by a high spin-down power pulsar. This low-energy component is not needed if the point-like TeV source is unrelated to the extended GeV and TeV sources. The interacting SNR scenario is supported by the spatial coincidence between the gamma-ray sources, the detection of OH maser lines and the hadronic modeling.},

abstract = {A 5.5-year Fermi LAT gamma-ray observation shows significant extended emission at the position of the supernova remnant HB9 (G160.9+2.6). The significance of the detection above the background for photon energies above 0.2 GeV is 21-sigma. The gamma-ray flux above 0.2 GeV is 3.2E-8 photons/cm2/s, and the corresponding luminosity above 1 GeV is 1.5E33 erg/s (for a source distance of 1 kpc). The gamma-ray spectrum of the source is best described by a power-law with an exponential cutoff in energy (E^(-s) exp(-E/Ec)) with photon index s ~ 1.7 and cutoff energy Ec ~ 2.5 GeV. The spectrum is consistent with both leptonic and hadronic models, and the relevant physical parameters in each case are derived. More studies on the ambient density in the region of HB9 should be carried out to rule out or confirm hadronic and non-thermal bremsstrahlung scenarios for the gamma-ray emission.},

Its true shape has been difficult to determine1, and as a result it has never been clear whether the pulsar seen in that part of the sky resulted from the same explosion that created the remnant 2. Here we present an X-ray image of the Vela supernova remnant which shows that the pulsar is close to the centre, and therefore most probably resulted from the same explosion. We see six extended X-ray features outside the blast-wave front, which apparently originated close to the pulsar. We propose that these features result from the passage through the surrounding medium of fragments formed by instabilities during the collapse and subsequent explosion of the progenitor star.},

abstract = {The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) First Source Catalog (1FGL) provided spatial, spectral, and temporal properties for a large number of $\gamma$-ray sources using a uniform analysis method. After correlating with the most-complete catalogs of source types known to emit $\gamma$ rays, 630 of these sources are "unassociated" (i.e., have no obvious counterparts at other wavelengths). Here, we employ two statistical analyses of the primary $\gamma$-ray characteristics for these unassociated sources in an effort to correlate their $\gamma$-ray properties with the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and pulsar populations in 1FGL. Based on the correlation results, we classify 221 AGN-like and 134 pulsar-like sources in the 1FGL unassociated sources. The results of these source "classifications" appear to match the expected source distributions, especially at high Galactic latitudes. While useful for planning future multiwavelength follow-up observations, these analyses use limited inputs, and their predictions should not be considered equivalent to "probable source classes" for these sources. We discuss multiwavelength results and catalog cross-correlations to date, and provide new source associations for 229 Fermi-LAT sources that had no association listed in the 1FGL catalog. By validating the source classifications against these new associations, we find that the new association matches the predicted source class in ~80% of the sources.},

The field also covers a region of the inner Galaxy, within 2-3 kpc from the Sun. The data set consists of a sample of H i: regions/reflection nebulae, for which we have (spectro-) photometric distances, and their associated molecular clouds (for which we have radial velocities). The velocity field includes non-circular motions, and consequently can be used to derive kinematic distances of objects for which only the position and radial velocity (Vlsr) are available. Adding H I tangent point data to the sample of H II regions/reflection nebulae, the data set covers a range in R from R≍02R0 to R≍2R0. For R0=8.5 kpc and $\Theta$0=220 km s-1, the best fit of a rotation curve of the form $\Theta$/$\Theta$0 = $\alpha$1(R/R0)$\alpha$2 + $\alpha$3 is obtained with $\alpha$1 = 1.00767, $\alpha$2 = 0.0394, and $\alpha$3 = 0.00712. The curve is approximately flat, but the outermost points indicate a slight rise in rotational velocity. We find that Oort's constant A = 12.6 km s-1 kpc-1. The mass of the Galaxy within R = 2R0 is found to be 4.1 1011 Msun. The velocity residuals (observed Vlsr minus Vlsr expected from circular rotation) show a pattern which suggests deviations from circular rotation that are consistent with spiral density wave streaming. No clear evidence of spiral structure is seen in the spatial distribution of the early type stars in our sample. Streaming motions (i.e. the systematic component of the velocity residuals) are found, with a mean value of ≍ 12 km s-1, implying 2-D values of ≍ 17 km s-1. We find that the molecular gas is streaming past the LSR, from l=180$\,^{\circ}$ to l=0$\,^{\circ}$, at about 3.8 km s-1. The rotation curves fitted to Northern and Southern Hemisphere data separately, are found to differ only slightly (the difference between the rotational velocities at 20 kpc being about 5%); this implies that, to first order, the galactic velocity field is axisymmetric. From a sample of local molecular clouds (between 0.7 and 2 kpc from the Sun), we derive the height of the Sun above the plane to be 13$\pm$7 pc. The scale height of these clouds is about 65 Pc.},

abstract = {Cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and nuclei interact with the Galactic interstellar gas and produce high-energy $\gamma$ rays. The $\gamma$-ray emission rate per hydrogen atom, called emissivity, provides a unique indirect probe of the CR flux. We present the measurement and the interpretation of the emissivity in the solar neighborhood for $\gamma$-ray energy from 50~MeV to 50~GeV. We analyzed a subset of 4 years of observations from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the {\it Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope} ({\it Fermi}) restricted to absolute latitudes $10^o<|b| <70^o$. From a fit to the LAT data including atomic, molecular and ionized hydrogen column density templates as well as a dust optical depth map we derived the emissivities, the molecular hydrogen to CO conversion factor $X_{CO}=(0.902\pm0.007) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$ and the dust-to-gas ratio $X_{DUST}=(41.4\pm0.3) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ mag$^{-1}$. Moreover we detected for the first time $\gamma$-ray emission from ionized hydrogen. We compared the extracted emissivities to those calculated from $\gamma$-ray production cross-sections and to CR spectra measured in the heliosphere. We observed that the experimental emissivities are reproduced only if the solar modulation is accounted for. This provides a direct detection of solar modulation observed previously through the anticorrelation between CR fluxes and solar activity. Finally we fitted a parametrized spectral form to the heliospheric CR observations as well as to the {\it Fermi}-LAT emissivity and obtained compatible local interstellar spectra for proton and Helium kinetic energy per nucleon between between 1 and 100~GeV and for electron-positrons between 0.1 and 100~GeV.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present high-energy neutrino spectra from 21 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), derived from gamma-ray measurements in the GeV-TeV range. We find that only the strongest sources, i.e. G40.5-0.5 in the north and Vela Junior in the south could be detected as single point sources by IceCube or KM3NeT, respectively. For the first time, it is also possible to derive a diffuse signal by applying the observed correlation between gamma-ray emission and radio signal. Radio data from 234 supernova remnants listed in Green's catalog are used to show that the total diffuse neutrino flux is approximately a factor of 2.5 higher compared to the sources that are resolved so far. We show that the signal at above 10 TeV energies can actually become comparable to the diffuse neutrino flux component from interactions in the interstellar medium. Recently, the IceCube collaboration announced the detection of a first diffuse signal of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos. Directional information cannot unambiguously reveal the nature of the sources at this point due to low statistics. A number of events come from close to the Galactic center and one of the main questions is whether at least a part of the signal can be of Galactic nature. In this paper, we show that the diffuse flux from well-resolved SNRs is at least a factor of 20 below the observed flux.},

abstract = {Since from their discovery in 1912, Cosmic-Rays (CRs) are one of the most debated issues of the high energy astrophysics. Their origin is still a fundamental problem and is the subject of very intense research. Until now, the best candidate sources of Galactic CR component are Supernova Remnants (SNRs) but final proof for the origin of CRs up to the knee can only be obtained through two fundamental signatures, the detection of a clear gamma-ray signature of $\pi$0 decay in Galactic sources and the identification of sources emitting a photon spectrum up to PeV energies. Both indications are quite difficult to obtain. The two gamma-ray satellites, AGILE and Fermi, together with ground telescopes operating in the TeV energy range (HESS, VERITAS and MAGIC), collected a great amount of data from SNRs. In spite of the recent discovery of the neutral pion spectral signature in the SNR W44 spectrum by AGILE (and confirmed by Fermi-LAT), all gamma-ray data collected at GeV and TeV energies for several young and middle-aged SNRs provide interesting challenges to current theoretical models. The emerging view from gamma-ray and particle detection is intriguing and lead to revisit the CR-SNR paradigm, considering also the contribution of other kind of sources.},

abstract = {The Fermi-LAT data appear to have an excess of gamma rays from the inner 150 pc of the Galactic Center. The main explanations proposed for this are: an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs), dark matter (DM) annihilation, and nonthermal bremsstrahlung produced by a population of electrons interacting with neutral gas in molecular clouds. The first two options have spatial templates well fitted by the square of a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with inner slope $\gamma=1.2$. We model the third option with a 20-cm continuum emission Galactic Ridge template. A template based on the HESS residuals is shown to give similar results. The gamma-ray excess is found to be best fit by a combination of the generalized NFW squared template and a Galactic Ridge template. We also find the spectra of each template is not significantly affected in the combined fit and is consistent with previous single template fits. That is the generalized NFW squared spectrum can be fit by either of order 1000 unresolved MSPs or DM with mass around 30 GeV, a thermal cross section, and mainly annihilating to $b \bar{b}$ quarks. While the Galactic Ridge continues to have a spectrum consistent with a population of nonthermal electrons whose spectrum also provides a good fit to synchrotron emission measurements. We also show that the current DM fit may be hard to test, even with 10 years of Fermi-LAT data, especially if there is a mixture of DM and MSPs contributing to the signal, in which case the implied DM cross section will be suppressed.

abstract = {We present an analysis of the interstellar medium (ISM) toward the $\gamma$-ray supernova remnant (SNR) W44. We used NANTEN2 12CO(J = 2-1) and 12CO(J = 1-0) data and Arecibo H I data in order to identify the molecular and atomic gas in the SNR. We confirmed that the molecular gas is located in the SNR shell with a primary peak toward the eastern edge of the shell. We newly identified high-excitation molecular gas along the eastern shell of the SNR in addition to the high-excitation broad gas previously observed inside the shell; the line intensity ratio between the 12CO(J = 2-1) and 12CO(J = 1-0) transitions in these regions is greater than ~1.0, suggesting a kinetic temperature of 30 K or higher, which is most likely due to heating by shock interaction. By comparing the ISM with $\gamma$-rays, we find that target protons of hadronic origin are dominated by molecular protons of average density around 200 cm-3, where the possible contribution of atomic protons is 10% or less. This average density is consistent with the recent discovery of the low-energy $\gamma$-rays suppressed in 50 MeV-10 GeV as observed with AGILE and Fermi. The $\gamma$-ray spectrum differs from place to place in the SNR, suggesting that the cosmic-ray (CR) proton spectrum significantly changes within the middle-aged SNR perhaps due to the energy-dependent escape of CR protons from the acceleration site. We finally derive a total CR proton energy of ~1049 erg, consistent with the SN origin of the majority of the CRs in the Galaxy.},

abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) are one of the most energetic astrophysical events and are thought to be the dominant source of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs). A recent report on observations from the Fermi satellite has shown a signature of pion decay in the gamma-ray spectra of SNRs. This provides strong evidence that high-energy protons are accelerated in SNRs. The actual gamma-ray emission from pion decay should depend on the diffusion of CRs in the interstellar medium. In order to quantitatively analyse the diffusion of high-energy CRs from acceleration sites, we have performed test particle numerical simulations of CR protons using a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of an interstellar medium swept-up by a blast wave. We analyse the diffusion of CRs at a length scale of order a few pc in our simulated SNR, and find the diffusion of CRs is precisely described by a Bohm diffusion, which is required for efficient acceleration at least for particles with energies above 30 TeV for a realistic interstellar medium. Although we find the possibility of a superdiffusive process (travel distance proportional to t^0.75) in our simulations, its effect on CR diffusion at the length scale of the turbulence in the SNR is limited.},

abstract = {We present the third Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) source catalog (3FGL) of sources in the 100 MeV--300 GeV range. Based on the first 4 yr of science data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission, it is the deepest yet in this energy range. Relative to the Second Fermi LAT catalog, the 3FGL catalog incorporates twice as much data, as well as a number of analysis improvements, including improved calibrations at the event reconstruction level, an updated model for Galactic diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission, a refined procedure for source detection, and improved methods for associating LAT sources with potential counterparts at other wavelengths. The 3FGL catalog includes 3033 sources above 4$\sigma$ significance, with source location regions, spectral properties, and monthly light curves for each. Of these, 78 are flagged as potentially being due to imperfections in the model for Galactic diffuse emission. Twenty-five sources are modeled explicitly as spatially extended, and overall 238 sources are considered as identified based on angular extent or correlated variability (periodic or otherwise) observed at other wavelengths. For 1010 sources we have not found plausible counterparts at other wavelengths. More than 1100 of the identified or associated sources are active galaxies of the blazar class; several other classes of non-blazar active galaxies are also represented in the 3FGL. Pulsars represent the largest Galactic source class. From source counts of Galactic sources we estimate that the contribution of unresolved sources to the Galactic diffuse emission is ∼3% at 1 GeV.},

abstract = {Aims. We use 5 years of Fermi-LAT data towards the Galactic-centre giant molecular cloud complex, Sagittarius B, to test questions of how well-mixed the Galactic component of cosmic rays are and what the level of the cosmic-ray sea in different parts of the Galaxy is. Methods. We use dust-opacity maps from the Planck satellite to obtain independent methods for background subtraction and an estimate for the mass of the region. We then present high-quality spectra of gamma-ray emission from 0.3 to 30 GeV and obtain an estimate of the cosmic-ray spectrum from the region. Results. We obtain an estimate of the mass of the region of $1.5 \pm 0.2 \times 10^7~\rm M_{\odot}$ using the Planck data, which agrees well with molecular-line-derived estimates for the same region. We find the the gamma-ray flux from this region is fitted well with a cosmic-ray spectrum that is the same as is observed locally, with evidence of a small over-density at intermediate (1-10 GeV) energies. Conclusions. We conclude that the gamma-ray and cosmic-ray spectrum in the region can be well-fitted using a local cosmic-ray spectrum.},

abstract = {One of the most prominent features of the $\gamma$-ray sky is the emission from our own Galaxy. The Galactic plane has been observed by Fermi-LAT in GeV and H.E.S.S. in TeV light. Fermi has modeled the Galactic emission as the sum of a complex 'diffuse' emission model with the predominately point source catalogs of 1FHL and 2FGL, while H.E.S.S. has primarily detected extended TeV sources. At GeV energies, Galactic diffuse emission dominates the $\gamma$-ray Milky Way but, as sources have hard spectra, it is likely their emission dominates at TeV energies. Generally the spatial shape and fraction of source emission compared to diffuse emission in the Galactic plane is not well known and is dependent on the source detection method, threshold and diffuse emission modeling methods used. We present a simple image-analysis based method applied to Fermi-LAT data from 10 GeV to 500 GeV, covering a region of +/- 5 degrees in Galactic latitude and +/- 100 degrees in Galactic longitude, to separate source and diffuse emission. This method involves elongated filter smoothing, combined with significance clipping to exclude sources. We test the method against models based on the 1FHL catalog and very simple model Galaxies to evaluate the response for an input of known fraction and shape of diffuse and source emission.},

abstract = {A large fraction of Galactic very-high energy (VHE; E$\gtrsim$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray sources is cataloged as unidentified. In this work we explore the possibility that these unidentified sources are located in ambients particularly rich in material content unaccounted by traditional tracers. In a scenario where the VHE emission is due to the interaction of the accelerated particles with a target mass, a large mass of untraced material could be substantially contributing to the VHE emission from these regions. Here, we use three tracers for the commonly explored components: intensity of the $^\textrm{12}$CO(1$\rightarrow$0) line to trace the molecular material, HI hyperfine transition at 21cm to trace atomic hydrogen, and dust emission to trace the total hydrogen content. We show that the estimates of material content from these three tracers are compatible if the uncertainty on the respective conversion factors is taken into account. No additional gas component is found in these regions. However, a simple mass estimation from the $^\textrm{12}$CO(1$\rightarrow$0) line intensity might underestimate the total mass component in some locations.},

For each class of objects we adopted same selection criteria. First, we renalyze the galactic rotation curve using each class of object with the form $\Theta$/$\Theta$0 = a1 (R/R0 )a2 + a3 (Brand {\&} Blitz 1993). We find cluster and AGB stars have big deviations. And we compare the rotation curve of each object to find AGB stars are not good at fitting rotation curve. So we use other kinds of objects to fit the rotation curve. Then, we compare the rotation curve of quadrant I, II and quadrant III, IV to find the effect of the spiral arms, the streaming motion and mass asymmetry in the Milky Way . Last, we use the choosen data to obtain a rotation curve with a mass distribution model of the Galaxy; there are three components in this model: the spheroid, the disk and the halo (Paczynski 1990). the mass of the Milky Way which we obtain from the model is agreement with the latest values in the literature. The new Galactic constants R0 = 8.0 kpc, and $\Theta$0 = 220.0 km s-1 were adopted in our work.},

abstract = {Diffuse gamma-ray emission has long been established as the most prominent feature in the GeV sky. Although the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique has been successful in revealing a large population of discrete TeV gamma-ray sources, a thorough investigation of diffuse emission at TeV energies is still pending. Data from the Galactic Plane Survey (GPS) obtained by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) have now achieved a sensitivity and coverage adequate for probing signatures of diffuse emission in the energy range of ~100 GeV to a few TeV. Gamma-rays are produced in cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium (aka "sea of cosmic rays") and in inverse Compton scattering on cosmic photon fields. This inevitably leads to guaranteed gamma-ray emission related to the gas content along the line-of-sight. Further contributions relate to those gamma-ray sources that fall below the current detection threshold and the aforementioned inverse Compton emission. Based on the H.E.S.S. GPS, we present the first observational assessment of diffuse TeV gamma-ray emission. The observation is compared with corresponding flux predictions based on the HI (LAB data) and CO (as a tracer of H2, NANTEN data) gas distributions. Consequences for unresolved source contributions and the anticipated level of inverse Compton emission are discussed.},

We attempt here the interpretation of the Fermi-LAT IGRB data in terms of the gamma-ray unresolved emission from different extragalactic populations. We find very good fits to the experimental IGRB, obtained with theoretical predictions for the emission from active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies. In addition, we probe a possible emission coming from the annihilation of weakly interacting dark matter (DM) particles in the halo of our Galaxy. We set stringent limits on its annihilation cross section into gamma rays, which are about the thermal relic value for a wide range of DM masses. We also identify regions in the DM mass and annihilation cross section parameter space which can significantly improve the fit to the IGRB data. Our analysis is conducted within the different IGRB data sets obtained from different models for the Galactic emission, which is shown to add a significant ambiguity on the IGRB interpretation.

The model is based on spherically symmetric hydrodynamic equations complemented with transport equations for relativistic particles. For the first time, the acceleration of electrons and protons by both forward and reverse shocks is studied through detailed numerical calculations. We model the energy spectra and spatial distributions of nonthermal emission of the young supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 and compare the calculations with the spectral and morphological properties of this object obtained in broad energy band from radio to very high energy gamma-rays. We discuss the advantages and shortcomings of the so-called hadronic and leptonic models which assume that the observed TeV gamma-ray emission is produced by accelerated protons and electrons, respectively. We discuss also a "composite" scenario when the gamma-ray flux from the main parts of the shell has inverse Compton origin, but with a non-negligible contribution of hadronic origin from dense clouds interacting with the shell.},

abstract = {It is shown that charged particles can be accelerated to high energies in astrophysical shock fronts. Fast particles are prevented from streaming away upstream of a shock front by scattering off Alfven waves which they themselves generate. This scattering confines the particles to the region around the shock and results in first-order Fermi acceleration due to the particles crossing the shock many times. The consequent energy spectrum is a power law with an index close to that observed for galactic cosmic rays. The discussion relates to particles which are already relativistic, and their initial acceleration from thermal energies is not considered.},

abstract = {The contributions of different radiation mechanisms to the diffuse {gamma -ray} emission of the galactic disk are studied in a broad energy region from 104 to 1014 eV. Our analysis shows that at energies between 1 and 100 MeV the radiation is dominated by the bremsstrahlung of relatively low energy, typically less than 1 GeV electrons, but with a non-negligible contribution from the inverse Compton (IC) scattering of higher energy electrons. Also, a significant fraction of the radiation observed at energies around 1 MeV could be contributed by mildly relativistic positrons annihilating ``in flight'' with the ambient thermal electrons. At energies from 100 MeV to 100 GeV the gamma -ray flux is dominated by interactions of cosmic ray protons and nuclei with the ambient gas through production and subsequent decay of secondary pi 0-mesons. The interpretation of the GeV gamma -ray emission of the inner Galaxy as a truly diffuse radiation requires a substantially harder spectrum of relativistic protons and nuclei in the interstellar medium compared with the local cosmic ray spectrum measured directly in the solar neighborhood. In the very high energy domain, E$\gamma$ >= 100 GeV, the contribution of the IC component of radiation may become comparable with, or even could exceed the fluxes of pi 0-decay component if the energy spectrum of electrons injected into the interstellar medium extends well beyond 1 TeV. Another signature of multi-TeV electrons is the synchrotron radiation which could account for a significant fraction of the diffuse hard X-ray flux of the galactic ridge. The future detailed studies of spatial and spectral characteristics of {gamma -ray} emission of the galactic disk, especially at very high energies around 100 GeV by GLAST, and hopefully also at TeV energies by planned ground-based instruments should provide important insight into the understanding of the sites and mechanisms of acceleration of galactic cosmic rays and the character of their propagation in the interstellar magnetic fields.},

abstract = {Very-high energy (VHE) gamma quanta contribute only a minuscule fraction - below one per million - to the flux of cosmic rays. Nevertheless, being neutral particles they are currently the best "messengers" of processes from the relativistic/ultra-relativistic Universe because they can be extrapolated back to their origin. The window of VHE gamma rays was opened only in 1989 by the Whipple collaboration, reporting the observation of TeV gamma rays from the Crab nebula. After a slow start, this new field of research is now rapidly expanding with the discovery of more than 150 VHE gamma-ray emitting sources. Progress is intimately related with the steady improvement of detectors and rapidly increasing computing power. We give an overview of the early attempts before and around 1989 and the progress after the pioneering work of the Whipple collaboration. The main focus of this article is on the development of experimental techniques for Earth-bound gamma-ray detectors; consequently, more emphasis is given to those experiments that made an initial breakthrough rather than to the successors which often had and have a similar (sometimes even higher) scientific output as the pioneering experiments. The considered energy threshold is about 30 GeV. At lower energies, observations can presently only be performed with balloon or satellite-borne detectors. Irrespective of the stormy experimental progress, the success story could not have been called a success story without a broad scientific output. Therefore we conclude this article with a summary of the scientific rationales and main results achieved over the last two decades.

abstract = {While from the energetic point of view SNRs are viable sources of Galactic CRs, the issue of whether they can accelerate protons up to PeV remains unsolved. Here we discuss particle acceleration at the forward shock of SN and discuss the possibility that the escaping particle current may excite a non-resonant instability that in turn leads to the formation of resonant modes confining particles close to the shock and increasing the maximum energy. This mechanism works throughout the expansion of the SN explosion, from the ejecta dominated (ED) to the Sedov-Taylor (ST) phase. Because of their higher explosion rate,we focus on type II SNae expanding in the slow, dense red supergiant wind. When the explosion occurs in such winds, the transition between the ED and the ST phase is likely to take place within a few tens of years. As a result, the spectrum of accelerated particles shows a break in the slope, at the maximum energy (Em) achieved at the beginning of the ST phase. Above this energy, the spectrum becomes steeper but remains a power law than developing an exponential cutoff. We show that for type II SNae typical parameters, proton Em can easily reach PeV energies, confirming that type II SNRs are the best candidate sources for CRs at the knee. We have tried to fit KASCADE-Grande, ARGO -YBJ and YAC1-Tibet Array data with our model but we could not find any parameter combination that could explain all data sets. Indeed the recent measurement of the proton and helium spectra in the knee region, with the ARGO-YBJ and YAC1-Tibet Array, has made the situation very confused. These measurements suggest that the knee in the light component is at 650 TeV, appreciably below the overall spectrum knee. This finding would resolve the problem of reaching very high energies in SNae, but, on the other hand, it would open a critical issue in the transition region between Galactic and extragalactic CRs.},

Unidentified molecular clouds irradiated by CR, and beyond 2 kpc are found to be possible sources, with indications that approximately 60 percent of the COS B sources can be explained this way. In addition, the presence of large scale cosmic ray gradients in the Galaxy is considered, and low energy cosmic ray sources are suggested to be particles distributed rapidly so that interaction in a particular cloud is from general ambient cosmic radiation.},

We show that none of them are adequate on distances smaller than the maximal scale lmax⁡˜100pc of fluctuations in the turbulent interstellar magnetic field. As a result, we predict anisotropic gamma-ray emissions around CR proton and electron sources, even for uniform densities of target gas. The centers of extended emission regions may have non-negligible offsets from their sources, leading to risks of misidentification. Gamma rays from CR filaments have steeper energy spectra than those from surrounding regions. We point out that gamma-ray telescopes can be used in the future as a new way to probe and deduce the parameters of the interstellar magnetic field.},

abstract = {The supernova paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays has been deeply affected by the development of the non-linear theory of particle acceleration at shock waves. Here we discuss the implications of applying such theory to the calculation of the spectrum of cosmic rays at Earth as accelerated in supernova remnants and propagating in the Galaxy. The spectrum is calculated taking into account the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles on the shock, the generation of magnetic turbulence which enhances the scattering near the shock, and the dynamical reaction of the amplified field on the plasma. Most important, the spectrum of cosmic rays at Earth is calculated taking into account the flux of particles escaping from upstream during the Sedov-Taylor phase and the adiabatically decompressed particles confined in the expanding shell and escaping at later times. We show how the spectrum obtained in this way is well described by a power law in momentum with spectral index close to -4, despite the concave shape of the instantaneous spectra of accelerated particles. On the other hand we also show how the shape of the spectrum is sensible to details of the acceleration process and environment which are and will probably remain very poorly known.},

abstract = {Due to its centrally bright X-ray morphology and limb brightened radio profile, MSH 11-61A (G290.1-0.8) is classified as a mixed morphology supernova remnant (SNR). H$\textsc{i}$ and CO observations determined that the SNR is interacting with molecular clouds found toward the north and southwest regions of the remnant. In this paper we report on the detection of $\gamma$-ray emission coincident with MSH 11-61A, using 70 months of data from the Large Area Telescope on board the \textit{Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope}. To investigate the origin of this emission, we perform broadband modelling of its non-thermal emission considering both leptonic and hadronic cases and concluding that the $\gamma$-ray emission is most likely hadronic in nature. Additionally we present our analysis of a 111 ks archival \textit{Suzaku} observation of this remnant. Our investigation shows that the X-ray emission from MSH 11-61A arises from shock-heated ejecta with the bulk of the X-ray emission arising from a recombining plasma, while the emission towards the east arises from an ionising plasma.},

abstract = {The breakthrough developments of Cherenkov telescopes in the last decade have led to angular resolution of 0.1{\deg} and an unprecedented sensitivity. This has allowed the current generation of Cherenkov telescopes to discover a population of supernova remnants (SNRs) radiating in very-high-energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) gamma-rays. A number of those VHE SNRs exhibit a shell-type morphology spatially coincident with the shock front of the SNR. The members of this VHE shell SNR club are RX J1713.7-3946, Vela Jr, RCW 86, SN 1006, and HESS J1731-347. The latter two objects have been poorly studied in high-energy (HE, 0.1<E<100 GeV) gamma-rays and need to be investigated in order to draw the global picture of this class of SNRs and constrain the characteristics of the underlying population of accelerated particles. Using 6 years of Fermi P7 reprocessed data, we studied the HE counterpart of the SNRs HESS J1731-347 and SN 1006. The two SNRs are not detected in the data and given that there is no hint of detection, we do not expect any detection in the coming years from the SNRs. However in both cases, we derived upper limits that significantly constrain the gamma-ray emission mechanism and can rule out a standard hadronic scenario with a confidence level > 5 sigma. With this Fermi analysis, we now have a complete view of the HE to VHE gamma-ray emission of TeV shell SNRs. All five sources have a hard HE photon index (<1.8) suggesting a common scenario where the bulk of the emission is produced by accelerated electrons radiating from radio to VHE gamma-rays through synchrotron and inverse Compton processes. In addition when correcting for the distance, all SNRs show a surprisingly similar gamma-ray luminosity supporting the idea of a common emission mechanism. While the gamma-ray emission is likely to be leptonic dominated, this does not rule out efficient hadron acceleration in those SNRs.},

abstract = {Cosmic rays up to at least PeV energies are usually described in the framework of an elementary scenario that involves acceleration by objects that are located in the disk of the Milky Way, such as supernova remnants or massive star-forming regions, and then diffusive propagation throughout the Galaxy. Details of the propagation process are so far inferred mainly from the composition of cosmic rays measured near the Earth and then extrapolated to the whole Galaxy. The details of the propagation in the Galactic halo and the escape into the intergalactic medium remain uncertain. The densities of cosmic rays in specific locations can be traced via the gamma rays they produce in inelastic collisions with clouds of interstellar gas. Therefore, we analyze 73 months of Fermi-LAT data from 300 MeV to 10 GeV in the direction of several high- and intermediate-velocity clouds that are located in the halo of the Milky Way. These clouds are supposed to be free of internal sources of cosmic rays and hence any gamma-ray emission from them samples the large-scale distribution of Galactic cosmic rays. We evaluate for the first time the gamma-ray emissivity per hydrogen atom up to ~7 kpc above the Galactic disk. The emissivity is found to decrease with distance from the disk, which provides direct evidence that cosmic rays at the relevant energies originate therein. Furthermore, the emissivity of one of the targets, the upper intermediate-velocity Arch, hints at a 50% decline of the cosmic-ray intensity within 2 kpc from the disk.},

abstract = {While supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely thought to be powerful cosmic-ray accelerators, indirect evidence comes from a small number of well-studied cases. Here we systematically determine the gamma-ray emission detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) from all known Galactic SNRs, disentangling them from the sea of cosmic-ray generated photons in the Galactic plane. Using LAT data we have characterized the 1-100 GeV emission in 279 regions containing SNRs, accounting for systematic uncertainties caused by source confusion and instrumental response. We have also developed a method to explore some systematic effects on SNR properties caused by the modeling of the interstellar emission (IEM). The IEM contributes substantially to gamma-ray emission in the regions where SNRs are located. To explore the systematics we consider different model construction methods, different model input parameters, and independently fit the model components to the gamma-ray data. We will describe this analysis method in detail. In the First Fermi LAT SNR Catalog there are 30 sources classified as SNRs, using spatial overlap with the radio position. For all the remaining regions we evaluated upper limits on SNRs' emission. In this work we will present a study of the aggregate characteristics of SNRs, such as comparisons between GeV and radio sizes as well as fluxes and spectral indexes and with TeV.},

abstract = {Molecular clouds act as targets for cosmic rays (CR), revealing their presence through either gamma-ray emission due to proton-proton interactions, and/or through the ionization level in the cloud, produced by the CR flux. The ionization rate is a unique tool, to some extent complementary to the gamma-ray emission, in that it allows to constrain the CR spectrum especially for energies below the pion production rate ($\approx 280$ MeV). Here we study the effect of ionization on $H_2$ clouds due to both CR protons and electrons, using the fully relativistic ionization cross sections, which is important to correctly account for the contribution due to relativistic CRs. The contribution to ionization due to secondary electrons is also included self-consistently. The whole calculation has been implemented into a numerical code which is publicly accessible through a web-interface. The code also include the calculation of gamma-ray emission once the CR spectrum},

abstract = {Massive (>~8 M_solar) stars may end their lives in the molecular clouds in which they were born. O-type stars probably have sufficient photoionizing radiation and wind power to clear a region more than 15 pc in radius of molecular material. Early B stars (B1-B3 on the main sequence, or 8-12 M_solar stars) are not capable of this and may interact directly with molecular gas when they explode. Molecular clouds are known to be clumpy, with dense molecular clumps occupying only a few percent of the volume. A supernova remnant then evolves primarily in the interclump medium, which has a density n_H=5-25 H atoms cm^-3. The remnant becomes radiative at a radius of ~6 pc, forming a shell that is magnetically supported. The structure of the shell can be described by a self-similar solution. When this shell interacts with the dense clumps, the molecular shock fronts are driven by a considerable overpressure compared to the pressure in the rest of the remnant. The expected range of clump sizes leads to a complex velocity distribution, with the possibility of molecular gas accelerated to a high velocity. Observations of the remnants W44 and IC 443 can be understood in this model. W44 has a shell expanding at ~150 km s^-1 into a medium with density 4-5 cm^-3. The shock emission expected in such a model is consistent with the observed H$\alpha$ surface brightness and the [O I] 63 $\mu$m line luminosity. The clump interaction is seen in OH maser emission, which shows a magnetic field strength that is consistent with that expected in the model. IC 443 appears to be expanding at a lower velocity, 100 km s^-1, into an interclump medium with a higher density, ~15 cm^-3. The interaction of the radiative shell with molecular clumps can produce the molecular emission that is observed from IC 443. Both remnants are shell sources of radio synchrotron emission, which can be attributed to relativistic electrons in the cool radiative shell. If ambient cosmic-ray electrons are further accelerated by the shock front and by the postshock compression, the radio fluxes and the flat spectral indices of W44 and IC 443 can be explained. The energetic electrons are in a high-density shell and their bremsstrahlung emission can approximately produce the gamma-ray fluxes observed by EGRET. Molecular clouds have a significant uniform magnetic field component so that heat conduction is likely to be important in the hot interior and can explain the isothermal X-ray emission observed from the remnants.},

abstract = {The events recorded by ARGO-YBJ in more than five years of data collection have been analyzed to determine the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the Galactic plane at Galactic longitudes 25{\deg} < l < 100{\deg} and Galactic latitudes . The energy range covered by this analysis, from ~350 GeV to ~2 TeV, allows the connection of the region explored by Fermi with the multi-TeV measurements carried out by Milagro. Our analysis has been focused on two selected regions of the Galactic plane, i.e., 40{\deg} < l < 100{\deg} and 65{\deg} < l < 85{\deg} (the Cygnus region), where Milagro observed an excess with respect to the predictions of current models. Great care has been taken in order to mask the most intense gamma-ray sources, including the TeV counterpart of the Cygnus cocoon recently identified by ARGO-YBJ, and to remove residual contributions. The ARGO-YBJ results do not show any excess at sub-TeV energies corresponding to the excess found by Milagro, and are consistent with the predictions of the Fermi model for the diffuse Galactic emission. From the measured energy distribution we derive spectral indices and the differential flux at 1 TeV of the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the sky regions investigated.

abstract = {Astrophysical sources are now observed by many different instruments at different wavelengths, from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, with an unprecedented quality. Putting all these data together to form a coherent view, however, is a very difficult task. Each instrument has its own data format, software and analysis procedure, which are difficult to combine. It is for example very challenging to perform a broadband fit of the energy spectrum of the source. The Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework (3ML) aims to solve this issue, providing a common framework which allows for a coherent modeling of sources using all the available data, independent of their origin. At the same time, thanks to its architecture based on plug-ins, 3ML uses the existing official software of each instrument for the corresponding data in a way which is transparent to the user. 3ML is based on the likelihood formalism, in which a model summarizing our knowledge about a particular region of the sky is convolved with the instrument response and compared to the corresponding data. The user can choose between a frequentist analysis, and a Bayesian analysis. In the former, parameters of the model are optimized in order to obtain the best match to the data (i.e., the maximum of the likelihood). In the latter, the priors specified by the user are used to build the posterior distribution, which is then sampled with Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Multinest. Our implementation of this idea is very flexible, allowing the study of point sources as well as extended sources with arbitrary spectra. We will review the problem we aim to solve, the 3ML concepts and its innovative potential.},

abstract = {The acceleration to relativistic energies of the high-energy tail of the particle distribution produced by a shock front is discussed. In order to be accelerated, particles need be able to pass through the shock without being strongly deflected. It is argued, using earth's bow shock as an example, that a shock front produces large numbers of protons, and probably electrons also, which satisfy this condition. The resulting energy spectrum of these initially nonrelativistic particles is calculated. It yields an estimate of the density of cosmic-ray particles in a shocked gas and indicates that a large proportion of the random energy produced by a shock is given to accelerated particles. The synchrotron radio emission from the energetic electrons in a shocked gas is calculated, and the theoretical and observed flux densities of two supernova remnants (Tycho's SNR and Cas A) are compared and found to agree satisfactorily. The implications for the minimum energy of radio sources are considered, and the effect of multiple shocks on the cosmic-ray density evaluated.},

abstract = {We study the capability of low-energy cosmic rays (CR) to penetrate into diffuse clouds when they move from the hot ionized plasma to a cool cloud embedded in that plasma. The spectrum of CR inside a cloud can be remarkably different from the the one present in the hot interstellar medium because when CRs pass through a dense cloud of matter, they suffer energy losses due to ionization and nuclear interactions. Hence there is a net flux of CRs towards the cloud that can excite Alfv\'en waves. In turn, self-excited Alfv\'en waves enhances the diffusion of CRs near the edge of the cloud, forcing CRs to spend more time in this layer and increasing the amount of energy losses. The final effect is that the flux of CR entering into the cloud is strongly suppressed below an energy threshold whose value depends on ambient parameters. For the first time we use the full kinetic theory to describe this problem, coupling CRs and Alfv\'en waves through the streaming instability, and including the damping of the waves due to ion-neutral friction and the CR energy losses due to ionization and pion production. Differently from previous approaches, this method allow us to describe the full CR spectrum and the magnetic turbulence spectrum in the transition region between hot interstellar medium and the cloud. For the typical size and density of diffuse clouds in the Galaxy, we find that the flux of particles entering the cloud is strongly reduced below E~10-100 MeV, while for larger energies the CR spectrum remain unaltered.},

abstract = {High-energy gamma-ray emission has been detected recently from supernova remnants (SNRs) and their surroundings. The existence of molecular clouds near some of the SNRs suggests that the gamma rays originate predominantly from p-p interactions with cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated at a closeby SNR shock wave. Here we investigate the acceleration of CRs and the gamma-ray production in the cloud self-consistently by taking into account the interactions of the streaming instability and the background turbulence both at the shock front and in the ensuing propagation to the clouds. We focus on the later evolution of SNRs, when the conventional treatment of the streaming instability is valid but the magnetic field is enhanced due to Bell's current instability and/or the dynamo generation of magnetic field in the precursor region. We calculate the time dependence of the maximum energy of the accelerated particles. This result is then used to determine the diffusive flux of the runaway particles escaping the shock region, from which we obtain the gamma spectrum consistent with observations. Finally, we check the self-consistency of our results by comparing the required level of diffusion with the level of the streaming instability attainable in the presence of turbulence damping. The energy range of CRs subject to the streaming instability is able to produce the observed energy spectrum of gamma rays.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes astrophysical scenarios that may be detected at the upper end of the energy range of the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), as a result of cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion in the interstellar medium (ISM). Hadronic processes are considered as the source of $\gamma$-ray photons from localized molecular enhancements nearby accelerators. Two particular cases are presented: a) the possibility of detecting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with maxima above 1 GeV, which may be constrained by detection or non-detection at very-high energies (VHE) with observations by ground-based Cerenkov telescopes, and b) the possibility of detecting V-shaped, inverted spectra, due to confusion of a nearby (to the line of sight) arrangement of accelerator/target scenarios with different characteristic properties. We show that the finding of these signatures (in particular, a peak at the 1--100 GeV energy region) is indicative for an identification of the underlying mechanism producing the $\gamma$-rays that is realized by nature: which accelerator (age and relative position to the target cloud) and under which diffusion properties CR propagate.

Here I discuss some of the statistics of Galactic SNRs, including the observational selection effects that apply, and difficulties in obtaining distances for individual remnants from the `Sigma-D' relation. Comparison of the observed Galactic longitude distribution of a sample of bright Galactic SNRs -- which are not strongly affected by selection effects -- with those expected from models is used to constrain the Galactic distribution of SNRs. The best-fitting power-law/exponential model is more concentrated towards the Galactic centre than the widely used distribution obtained by Case {\&} Bhattacharya (1998).},

abstract = {The theory of first order Fermi acceleration at collisionless astrophysical shock fronts is reviewed. Observations suggest that shock waves in different astrophysical environments accelerate cosmic rays efficiently. In the first order process, high energy particles diffuse through Alfv{\'e}n waves that scatter them and couple them to the background plasma. These particles gain energy, on the average, every time they cross the schock front and bounce off approaching scattering centers. Calculations demonstrate that the distribution function transmitted by a plane shock is roughly a power law in momentum with slope similar to that inferred in galactic cosmic ray sources. The generation of the scattering Alfv{\'e}n waves by the streaming cosmic rays is described and it is argued that the wave amplitude is probably non-linear within sufficiently strong astrophysical shocks. Hydromagnetic scattering can operate on the thermal particles as well, possibly establishing the shock structure. This suggests a model of strong collisionless shocks in which high energy particles are inevitably produced very efficiently. Observable consequences of this model, together with its limitations and some alternatives, are described. Cosmic ray origin and astrophysical shocks can no longer be considered separately.},

abstract = {HESS J1858+020 is a TeV gamma-ray source that was reported not to have any clear cataloged counterpart at any wavelength. However, it has been recently proposed that this source is indirectly associated with the radio source, re-identified as a supernova remnant (SNR), G35.6-0.4. The latter is found to be middle-aged ($\sim 30$ kyr) and to have nearby molecular clouds (MCs). HESS J1858+020 was proposed to be the result of the interaction of protons accelerated in the SNR shell with target ions residing in the clouds. The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) First Source Catalog does not list any source coincident with the position of HESS J1858+020, but some lie close. Here, we analyse more than 2 years of data obtained with the Fermi-LAT for the region of interest, and consider whether it is indeed possible that the closest LAT source, 1FGL J1857.1+0212c, is related to HESS J1858+020. We conclude it is not, and we impose upper limits on the GeV emission originating from HESS J1858+020. Using a simplified 3D model for the cosmic-ray propagation out from the shell of the SNR, we consider whether the interaction between SNR G35.6-0.4 and the MCs nearby could give rise to the TeV emission of HESS J1858+020 without producing a GeV counterpart. If so, the pair of SNR/TeV source with no GeV detection would be reminiscent of other similarly-aged SNRs, such as some of the TeV hotspots near W28, for which cosmic-ray diffusion may be used to explain their multi-frequency phenomenology. However, for HESS J1858+020, we found that although the phase space in principle allows for such GeV--TeV non-correlation to appear, usual and/or observationally constrained values of the parameters (e.g., diffusion coefficients and cloud-SNR likely distances) would disfavor it.},

abstract = {The common approach to compute the cosmic ray distribution in a starburst galaxy or region is equivalent to assuming that at any point within that environment, there is an accelerator inputting cosmic rays at a reduced rate. This rate should be compatible with the overall volume-average injection, given by the total number of accelerators that were active during the starburst age. These assumptions seem reasonable, especially under the supposition of a homogeneous and isotropic distribution of accelerators. However, in this approach the temporal evolution of the superposed spectrum is not explicitly derived; rather, it is essentially assumed ab initio. Here, we test the validity of this approach by following the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of the superposed cosmic ray spectrum and compare our results with those from theoretical models that treat the starburst region as a single source. In the calorimetric limit (with no cosmic ray advection), homogeneity is reached (typically within 20 per cent) across most of the starburst region. However, values of centre-to-edge intensity ratios can amount to a factor of several. Differences between the common homogeneous assumption for the cosmic ray distribution and our models are larger in the case of two-zone geometries, such as a central nucleus with a surrounding disc. We have also found that the decay of the cosmic ray density following the duration of the starburst process is slow, and even approximately 1 Myr after the burst ends (for a gas density of 35 cm-3) it may still be within an order of magnitude of its peak value. Based on our simulations, it seems that the detection of a relatively hard spectrum up to the highest gamma-ray energies from nearby starburst galaxies favours a relatively small diffusion coefficient (i.e. long diffusion time) in the region where most of the emission originates.},

abstract = {As part of a continuing study of plerionic supernova remnants, we have closely examined the SNR G291.0-0.1 (MSH 11-62) at radio wavelengths following ASCA X-ray observations of this source. The high angular resolution, full-polarization radio observations at 13 and 20 cm support its plerionic nature; the remnant has an interior dominated by a bright, linearly-shaped, polarized central feature, and has an exterior composed of filamentary structure. No compact source suggestive of a pulsar or associated wind nebula was found. In addition, we observed HI absorption toward the remnant, which places it at or beyond 3.5 kpc. .},

We analyze 5.7 yr Fermi Large Area Telescope data of the SNR region and find a point source at a position consistent with the radio brightness peak of Kes 27, which is located in the eastern region of the SNR and caused by the interaction with a nearby HI cloud. The source's emission has a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2.5$\pm$0.1 and a >0.2 GeV luminosity of 5.8$\times$10$^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at a distance of 4.3 kpc. Comparing the properties of the source with that of other SNRs that are known to be interacting with nearby high-density clouds, we discuss the origin of the source's emission. The spectral energy distribution of the source can be described by a hadronic model that considers the interaction of protons, escaping from the shock front, with a high-density cloud.},

abstract = {The Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) IC 443 is one of the most studied core-collapse SNRs for its interaction with molecular clouds. However, the ambient molecular clouds with which IC 443 is interacting have not been thoroughly studied and remain poorly understood. Using the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory 14 m telescope, we obtained fully sampled maps of the ~1$\,^{\circ}$ × 1$\,^{\circ}$ region toward IC 443 in the 12CO J = 1-0 and HCO+ J = 1-0 lines. In addition to the previously known molecular clouds in the velocity range v LSR = -6 to -1 km s-1 (-3 km s-1 clouds), our observations reveal two new ambient molecular cloud components: small (~1') bright clouds in v LSR = -8 to -3 km s-1 (SCs) and diffuse clouds in v LSR = +3 to +10 km s-1 (+5 km s-1 clouds). Our data also reveal the detailed kinematics of the shocked molecular gas in IC 443 however, the focus of this paper is the physical relationship between the shocked clumps and the ambient cloud components. We find strong evidence that the SCs are associated with the shocked clumps. This is supported by the positional coincidence of the SCs with shocked clumps and other tracers of shocks. Furthermore, the kinematic features of some shocked clumps suggest that these are the ablated material from the SCs upon the impact of the SNR shock. The SCs are interpreted as dense cores of parental molecular clouds that survived the destruction by the pre-supernova evolution of the progenitor star or its nearby stars. We propose that the expanding SNR shock is now impacting some of the remaining cores and the gas is being ablated and accelerated, producing the shocked molecular gas. The morphology of the +5 km s-1 clouds suggests an association with IC 443. On the other hand, the -3 km s-1 clouds show no evidence for interaction.},

abstract = {Supernova remnants accelerate particles up to energies of at least 100 TeV as established by observations in very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray astronomy. Molecular clouds in their vicinity provide an increased amount of target material for proton-proton interaction and subsequent neutral pion decay into $\gamma$-rays of accelerated hadrons escaping the remnant. Therefore, these molecular clouds are potential $\gamma$-ray sources. The $\gamma$-ray emission from these clouds provides a unique environment to derive information on the propagation of very-high-energy particles through the interstellar medium as well as on the acceleration of hadrons in supernova remnants. Current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope systems are suitable to explore a large parameter space of the propagation properties depending on the age of the supernova remnant and the distance between the remnant and the nearby molecular cloud. In this paper we present our strategy and results of a systematic search for $\gamma$-ray emitting molecular clouds near supernova remnants which are potentially detectable with current experiments in the TeV energy range and explore the prospects of future experiments.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of detecting and characterizing local variability in time series and other forms of sequential data. The goal is to identify and characterize statistically significant variations, at the same time suppressing the inevitable corrupting observational errors. We present a simple nonparametric modeling technique and an algorithm implementing it - an improved and generalized version of Bayesian Blocks (Scargle 1998) - that finds the optimal segmentation of the data in the observation interval. The structure of the algorithm allows it to be used in either a real-time trigger mode, or a retrospective mode. Maximum likelihood or marginal posterior functions to measure model fitness are presented for events, binned counts, and measurements at arbitrary times with known error distributions. Problems addressed include those connected with data gaps, variable exposure, extension to piecewise linear and piecewise exponential representations, multi-variate time series data, analysis of variance, data on the circle, other data modes, and dispersed data. Simulations provide evidence that the detection efficiency for weak signals is close to a theoretical asymptotic limit derived by (Arias-Castro, Donoho and Huo 2003). In the spirit of Reproducible Research (Donoho et al. 2008) all of the code and data necessary to reproduce all of the figures in this paper are included as auxiliary material.},

abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) are a complex class of sources, and their heterogeneous nature has hindered the characterization of their general observational properties. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we use statistical tools to analyze the Chandra X-ray images of Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud SNRs. We apply two techniques, a power-ratio method (a multipole expansion) and wavelet-transform analysis, to measure the global and local morphological properties of the X-ray line and thermal emission in 24 SNRs. We find that Type Ia SNRs have statistically more spherical and mirror-symmetric thermal X-ray emission than core-collapse (CC) SNRs. The ability to type SNRs based on thermal emission morphology alone enables, for the first time, the typing of SNRs with weak X-ray lines and those with low-resolution spectra. Based on our analyses, we identify one source (SNR G344.7-0.1) as originating from a CC explosion that was of unknown origin previously; we also confirm the tentative Type Ia classifications of G337.2-0.7 and G272.2-3.2. Although the global morphology is indicative of the explosion type, the relative morphology of the X-ray line emission within SNRs is not: all sources in our sample have well-mixed ejecta, irrespective of stellar origin. In particular, we find that 90% of the bright metal-line-emitting substructures are spatially coincident and have similar scales, even if the metals arise from different burning processes. Moreover, the overall X-ray line morphologies within each SNR are the same, with <6% differences. These findings reinforce observationally that hydrodynamical instabilities can efficiently mix ejecta in Type Ia and CC SNRs. The only exception is W49B, which can be attributed to its jet-driven/bipolar explosive origin. Based on comparative analyses across our sample, we describe several observational constraints that can be used to test hydrodynamical models of SNR evolution; notably, the filling factor of X-ray emission decreases with SNR age.},

The accurate identification of power-law patterns has significant consequences for developing an understanding of complex systems. However, statistical evidence for or against the power-law hypothesis is complicated by large fluctuations in the empirical distribution's tail, and these are worsened when information is lost from binning the data. We adapt the statistically principled framework for testing the power-law hypothesis, developed by Clauset, Shalizi and Newman, to the case of binned data. This approach includes maximum-likelihood fitting, a hypothesis test based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit statistic and likelihood ratio tests for comparing against alternative explanations. We evaluate the effectiveness of these methods on synthetic binned data with known structure and apply them to twelve real-world binned data sets with heavy-tailed patterns.},

abstract = {The explosion of a supernova releases almost instantaneously about 10^51 ergs of mechanic energy, changing irreversibly the physical and chemical properties of large regions in the galaxies. The stellar ejecta, the nebula resulting from the powerful shock waves, and sometimes a compact stellar remnant, constitute a supernova remnant (SNR). They can radiate their energy across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, but the great majority are radio sources. Almost 70 years after the first detection of radio emission coming from a SNR, great progress has been achieved in the comprehension of their physical characteristics and evolution. We review the present knowledge of different aspects of radio remnants, focusing on sources of the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, where the SNRs can be spatially resolved. We present a brief overview of theoretical background, analyze morphology and polarization properties, and review and critical discuss different methods applied to determine the radio spectrum and distances. The consequences of the interaction between the SNR shocks and the surrounding medium are examined, including the question of whether SNRs can trigger the formation of new stars. Cases of multispectral comparison are presented. A section is devoted to reviewing recent results of radio SNRs in the Magellanic Clouds, with particular emphasis on the radio properties of SN 1987A, an ideal laboratory to investigate dynamical evolution of an SNR in near real time. The review concludes with a summary of issues on radio SNRs that deserve further study, and analyzing the prospects for future research with the latest generation radio telescopes.},

abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.

abstract = {The Cygnus region hosts one of the most remarkable star-forming regions in the Milky Way. Indeed, the total mass in molecular gas of the Cygnus X complex exceeds 10 times the total mass of all other nearby star-forming regions. Surveys at all wavelengths, from radio to gamma-rays, reveal that Cygnus contains such a wealth and variety of sources---supernova remnants (SNRs), pulsars, pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), H II regions, Wolf-Rayet binaries, OB associations, microquasars, dense molecular clouds and superbubbles---as to practically be a galaxy in microcosm. The gamma-ray observations along reveal a wealth of intriguing sources at energies between 1 GeV and tens of TeV. However, a complete understanding of the physical phenomena producing this gamma-ray emission first requires us to disentangle overlapping sources and reconcile discordant pictures at different energies. This task is made more challenging by the limited angular resolution of instruments such as the Fermi Large Area Telescope, ARGO-YBJ, and HAWC and the limited sensitivity and field of view of current imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), with its improved angular resolution, large field of view, and order of magnitude gain in sensitivity over current IACTs, has the potential to finally create a coherent and well-resolved picture of the Cygnus region between a few tens of GeV and a hundred TeV. We describe a proposed strategy to study the Cygnus region using CTA data, which combines a survey of the whole region at $65^{\circ} < l < 85^{\circ}$ and $-3.5^{\circ} < b < 3.5^{\circ} $ with deeper observations of two sub-regions that host rich groups of known gamma-ray sources.},

However, a complete theory for CR transport outside the acceleration site has not been developed yet. Two physical processes are thought to be relevant to regulate the transport: the growth of waves caused by streaming instability, and possible wave damping mechanisms that reduce the growth of the turbulence. Only a few attempts have been made so far to incorporate these mechanisms in the theory of CR diffusion. In this work we present recent advances in this subject. In particular, we show results obtained by solving the coupled equations for the diffusion of CRs and the evolution of Alfven waves. We discuss the importance of streaming instabilities and wave damping in different ISM phases.},

abstract = {We describe our methodology for comparing the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and other complementary data sets to theoretical models. The unprecedented quality of the WMAP data and the tight constraints on cosmological parameters that are derived require a rigorous analysis so that the approximations made in the modeling do not lead to significant biases. We describe our use of the likelihood function to characterize the statistical properties of the microwave background sky. We outline the use of the Monte Carlo Markov Chains to explore the likelihood of the data given a model to determine the best-fit cosmological parameters and their uncertainties. We add to the WMAP data the l>~700 Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) and Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR) measurements of the CMB, the galaxy power spectrum at z~0 obtained from the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), and the matter power spectrum at z~3 as measured with the Ly$\alpha$ forest. These last two data sets complement the CMB measurements by probing the matter power spectrum of the nearby universe. Combining CMB and 2dFGRS requires that we include in our analysis a model for galaxy bias, redshift distortions, and the nonlinear growth of structure. We show how the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the model and the data are propagated through the full analysis. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

abstract = {Context: The spiral structure of our Milky Way Galaxy is not yet known. HII regions and giant molecular clouds are the most prominent spiral tracers. Models with 2-4 arms have been proposed to outline the structure of our Galaxy. Aims: Recently, new data of spiral tracers covering a larger region of the Galactic disk have been published. We wish to outline the spiral structure of the Milky way using all tracer data. Methods: We collected the spiral tracer data of our Milky Way from the literature, namely, HII regions and giant molecular clouds (GMCs). With weighting factors based on the excitation parameters of HII regions or the masses of GMCs, we fitted the distribution of these tracers with models of two, three, four spiral-arms or polynomial spiral arms. The distances of tracers, if not available from stellar or direct measurements, were estimated kinetically from the standard rotation curve of Brand {\&} Blitz (1993, A{\&}A, 275, 67) with R0 = 8.5 kpc, and $\Theta$0 = 220 km s-1 or the newly fitted rotation curves with R0 = 8.0 kpc and $\Theta$0 = 220 km s-1 or R0 = 8.4 kpc and $\Theta$0 = 254 km s-1. Results: We found that the two-arm logarithmic model cannot fit the data in many regions. The three- and the four-arm logarithmic models are able to connect most tracers. However, at least two observed tangential directions cannot be matched by the three- or four-arm model. We composed a polynomial spiral arm model, which can not only fit the tracer distribution but also match observed tangential directions. Using new rotation curves with R0 = 8.0 kpc and $\Theta$0 = 220 km s-1 and R0 = 8.4 kpc and $\Theta$0 = 254 km s-1 for the estimation of kinematic distances, we found that the distribution of HII regions and GMCs can fit the models well, although the results do not change significantly compared to the parameters with the standard R0 and $\Theta$_0.

abstract = {Searches for unknown physics and deciding between competing physical models to explain data rely on statistical hypotheses testing. A common approach, used for example in the discovery of the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, is based on the statistical Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) and its asymptotic properties. In the common situation, when neither of the two models under comparison is a special case of the other i.e., when the hypotheses are non-nested, this test is not applicable, and so far no efficient solution exists. In physics, this problem occurs when two models that reside in different parameter spaces are to be compared. An important example is the recently reported excess emission in astrophysical $\gamma$-rays and the question whether its origin is known astrophysics or dark matter. We develop and study a new, generally applicable, frequentist method and validate its statistical properties using a suite of simulations studies. We exemplify it on realistic simulated data of the Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray satellite, where non-nested hypotheses testing appears in the search for particle dark matter.},

abstract = {Aims: Molecular clouds act as primary targets for cosmic-ray interactions and are expected to shine in $\gamma$-rays as a by-product of these interactions. Indeed, several detected $\gamma$-ray sources both in HE and VHE $\gamma$-rays (HE: 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV; VHE: E > 100 GeV) have been directly or indirectly associated with molecular clouds. Information on the local diffusion coefficient and the cosmic-ray population can be inferred from the observed $\gamma$-ray signals. In this work we explore the capability of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array observatory (CTA) to provide such measurements. Methods: We investigate the expected emission from clouds hosting an accelerator, surveying the parameter space for different modes of acceleration, age of the source, cloud density profile, and cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient. Results: We present some of the most interesting cases for CTA regarding this science topic. The simulated $\gamma$-ray fluxes depend strongly on the input parameters. In several cases, we find that it will be possible to constrain both the properties of the accelerator and the propagation mode of cosmic rays in the cloud from CTA data alone.},

abstract = {In evolved supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds, such as IC 443, W44, and 3C391, a highly inhomogeneous structure consisting of a forward shock of moderate Mach number, a cooling layer, a dense radiative shell and an interior region filled with hot tenuous plasma is expected. We present a kinetic model of nonthermal electron injection, acceleration and propagation in that environment and find that these SNRs are efficient electron accelerators and sources of hard X- and gamma-ray emission. The energy spectrum of the nonthermal electrons is shaped by the joint action of first and second order Fermi acceleration in a turbulent plasma with substantial Coulomb losses. Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and inverse Compton radiation of the nonthermal electrons produce multiwavelength photon spectra in quantitative agreement with the radio and the hard emission observed by ASCA and EGRET from IC 443. We distinguish interclump shock wave emission from molecular clump shock wave emission accounting for a complex structure of molecular cloud. Spatially resolved X- and gamma- ray spectra from the supernova remnants IC 443, W44, and 3C391 as might be observed with BeppoSAX, Chandra XRO, XMM, INTEGRAL and GLAST would distinguish the contribution of the energetic lepton component to the gamma-rays observed by EGRET.

abstract = {The spiral structure of the Milky Way is not yet well determined. The keys to understanding this structure are to increase the number of reliable spiral tracers and to determine their distances as accurately as possible. HII regions, giant molecular clouds (GMCs), and 6.7-GHz methanol masers are closely related to high mass star formation, and hence they are excellent spiral tracers. We update the catalogs of Galactic HII regions, GMCs, and 6.7-GHz methanol masers, and then outline the spiral structure of the Milky Way. We collected data for more than 2500 known HII regions, 1300 GMCs, and 900 6.7-GHz methanol masers. If the photometric or trigonometric distance was not yet available, we determined the kinematic distance using a Galaxy rotation curve with the current IAU standard, $R_0$ = 8.5 kpc and $\Theta_0$ = 220 km s$^{-1}$, and the most recent updated values of $R_0$ = 8.3 kpc and $\Theta_0$ = 239 km s$^{-1}$, after we modified the velocities of tracers with the adopted solar motions. With the weight factors based on the excitation parameters of HII regions or the masses of GMCs, we get the distributions of these spiral tracers. The distribution of tracers shows at least four segments of arms in the first Galactic quadrant, and three segments in the fourth quadrant. The Perseus Arm and the Local Arm are also delineated by many bright HII regions. The arm segments traced by massive star forming regions and GMCs are able to match the HI arms in the outer Galaxy. We found that the models of three-arm and four-arm logarithmic spirals are able to connect most spiral tracers. The four-arm model provides a better match to the observed tangential directions of spiral arms, and is consistent with the two-fold symmetry of the Galaxy structure. A model of polynomial-logarithmic spirals not only delineates the tracer distribution but also matches the observed tangential directions.},

abstract = {A maximum likelihood (ML) technique for detecting compact sources in images of the x-ray sky is examined. Such images, in the relatively low exposure regime accessible to present x-ray observatories, exhibit Poissonian noise at background flux levels. A variety of source detection methods are compared via Monte Carlo, and the ML detection method is shown to compare favourably with the optimized-linear-filter (OLF) method when applied to a single image. Where detection proceeds in parallel on several images made in different energy bands, the ML method is shown to have some practical advantages which make it superior to the OLF method. Some criticisms of ML are discussed. Finally, a practical method of estimating the sensitivity of ML detection is presented, and is shown to be also applicable to sliding-box source detection.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of gamma-ray data obtained with the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in the region around supernova remnant (SNR) S147 (G180.0-1.7). A spatially extended gamma-ray source detected in an energy range of 0.2-10 GeV is found to coincide with SNR S147. We confirm its spatial extension at >5$\sigma$ confidence level. The gamma-ray flux is (3.8 $\pm$ 0.6) × 10-8 photons cm-2 s-1, corresponding to a luminosity of 1.3 × 1034 (d/1.3 kpc)2 erg s-1 in this energy range. The gamma-ray emission exhibits a possible spatial correlation with the prominent H$\alpha$ filaments of SNR S147. There is no indication that the gamma-ray emission comes from the associated pulsar PSR J0538+2817. The gamma-ray spectrum integrated over the remnant is likely dominated by the decay of neutral $\pi$ mesons produced through the proton-proton collisions in the filaments. The reacceleration of the pre-existing cosmic rays and subsequent adiabatic compression in the filaments is sufficient to provide the energy density required of high-energy protons.},

abstract = {The remnant G347.3-0.5 exhibits strong shell emission in the radio and X-ray bands, and has a purported detection in the TeV gamma-ray band by the CANGAROO-II telescope. The CANGAROO results were touted as evidence for the production of cosmic ray ions, a claim that has proven controversial due to constraining fluxes associated with a proximate unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1714-3857. HESS has now seen this source in the TeV band. The complex environment of the remnant renders modeling of its broadband spectrum sensitive to assumptions concerning the nature and parameters of the circumremnant medium. This paper explores a sampling of reasonable possibilities for multiwavelength spectral predictions from this source, using a non-linear model of diffusive particle acceleration at the shocked shell. The magnetic field strength, shell size and degree of particle cross-field diffusion act as variables to which the radio to X-ray to gamma-ray signal is sensitive. The modeling of the extant data constrains these variables, and the potential impact of the recent HESS detection on such parameters is addressed. Putative pion decay signals in hard gamma-rays resulting from hadronic interactions in dense molecular clouds are briefly discussed; the requisite suppression of the GeV component needed to accommodate the 3EG J1714-3857 EGRET data provides potential bounds on the diffusive distance from the shell to the proximate clouds.},

abstract = {The evidence for particle acceleration in supernova shells comes from electrons whose synchrotron emission is observed in radio and X-rays. Recent observations by the HESS instrument reveal that supernova remnants also emit TeV $\gamma$-rays, long-awaited experimental evidence that supernova remnants can accelerate cosmic rays up to the ``knee'' energies. Still, uncertainty exists whether these $\gamma$-rays are produced by electrons via inverse Compton scattering or by protons via $\pi$0-decay. The multiwavelength spectra of supernova remnants can be fitted with both mechanisms, although a preference is often given to $\pi$0-decay due to the spectral shape at very high energies. A recent study of the interstellar radiation field indicates that its energy density, especially in the inner Galaxy, is higher than previously thought. In this Letter we evaluate the effect of the interstellar radiation field on the inverse Compton emission of electrons accelerated in a supernova remnant located at different distances from the Galactic center. We show that contribution of optical and infrared photons to the inverse Compton emission may exceed the contribution of cosmic microwave background and in some cases broaden the resulting $\gamma$-ray spectrum. In addition, we show that if a supernova remnant is located close to the Galactic center, its $\gamma$-ray spectrum will exhibit a ``universal'' cutoff at very high energies due to the Klein-Nishina effect and not due to the cutoff of the electron spectrum. As an example, we apply our calculations to the supernova remnants RX J1713.7-3946 and G0.9+0.1, recently observed by HESS.},

abstract = {Using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate general properties of a blast wave shock interacting with interstellar clouds. The pre-shock cloudy medium is generated as a natural consequence of the thermal instability that simulates realistic clumpy interstellar clouds and their diffuse surrounding. The shock wave that sweeps the cloudy medium generates a turbulent shell through the vorticity generations that are induced by shock-cloud interactions. In the turbulent shell, the magnetic field is amplified as a result of turbulent dynamo action. The energy density of the amplified magnetic field can locally grow comparable to the thermal energy density, particularly at the transition layers between clouds and the diffuse surrounding. In the case of a young supernova remnant (SNR) with a shock velocity >~ 103 km s-1, the corresponding strength of the magnetic field is approximately 1 mG. The propagation speed of the shock wave is significantly stalled in the clouds because of the high density, while the shock maintains a high velocity in the diffuse surrounding. In addition, when the shock wave hits the clouds, reflection shock waves are generated that propagate back into the shocked shell. From these simulation results, many observational characteristics of the young SNR RX J1713.7-3946 that is suggested to be interacting with molecular clouds can be explained as follows. The reflection shocks can accelerate particles in the turbulent downstream region where the magnetic field strength reaches 1 mG, which causes short-time variability of synchrotron X-rays. Since the shock velocity is stalled locally in the clouds, the temperature in the shocked cloud is suppressed far below 1 keV. Thus, thermal X-ray line emission would be faint even if the SNR is interacting with molecular clouds. We also find that the photon index of the $\pi$0-decay gamma rays generated by cosmic-ray protons can be 1.5 (corresponding energy flux is $\nu$F $\nu$vprop$\nu$0.5) because the penetration depth of high-energy particles into the clumpy clouds depends on their energy. This suggests that, if we rely only on the spectral study, the hadronic gamma-ray emission is indistinguishable from the leptonic inverse Compton emission. We propose that the spatial correlation of the gamma-ray, X-ray, and CO line-emission regions can be conclusively used to understand the origin of gamma rays from RX J1713.7-3946.},

abstract = {The nearby Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) provides a rare opportunity for a spatially resolved view of an external star-forming galaxy in gamma-rays. At 0.1-100GeV energies, it was detected as an extended source with CGRO/EGRET and using early observations with the Fermi-LAT. The emission was found to correlate with massive star-forming regions and to be particularly bright towards 30 Doradus. Studies of the origin and transport of cosmic rays (CRs) in the Milky Way are frequently hampered by line-of-sight confusion and poor distance determination. The LMC offers a complementary way to address these questions, by revealing if and how the gamma-ray emission is connected to specific objects, populations of objects, and structures in the galaxy. We revisit the gamma-ray emission from the LMC using about 73 months of Fermi-LAT P7REP data in the 0.2-100GeV range. A complete spatial and spectral model of the LMC emission is developed. Several approaches are tested: a simple geometrical description, template-fitting, and a physically driven model for CR-induced interstellar emission. Besides PSR J0540-6919 identified through its pulsations, two hard sources were found positionally coincident with plerion N 157B and supernova remnant N 132D, which were also detected at TeV energies with H.E.S.S. We detect an additional soft source that is currently unidentified. Extended emission dominates the total flux from the LMC. It consists of an extended component about the size of the galaxy and additional emission from 3-4 regions with degree-scale sizes. If interpreted as CRs interacting with interstellar gas, the large-scale emission implies a large-scale population of ~1-100GeV CRs with density ~30% of the local Galactic value. On top of that, the 3-4 small-scale emission regions would correspond to enhancements of the CR density by factors 2 to 6 or higher (Abridged).},

abstract = {A joint spectral analysis of some Chandra ACIS X-ray data and Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope radio data was performed for 13 small regions along the bright northeastern rim of the supernova remnant SN 1006. These data were fitted with a synchrotron radiation model. The nonthermal electron spectrum used to compute the photon emission spectra is the traditional exponentially cut off power law, with one notable difference: The power-law index is not a constant. It is a linear function of the logarithm of the momentum. This functional form enables us to show, for the first time, that the synchrotron spectrum of SN 1006 seems to flatten with increasing energy. The effective power-law index of the electron spectrum is 2.2 at 1 GeV (i.e., radio synchrotron-emitting momenta) and 2.0 at about 10 TeV (i.e., X-ray synchrotron-emitting momenta). This amount of change in the index is qualitatively consistent with theoretical models of the amount of curvature in the proton spectrum of the remnant. The evidence of spectral curvature implies that cosmic rays are dynamically important instead of being ``test'' particles. The spectral analysis also provides a means of determining the critical frequency of the synchrotron spectrum associated with the highest-energy electrons. The critical frequency seems to vary along the northeastern rim, with a maximum value of 1.1+1.0-0.5×1017 Hz. This value implies that the electron diffusion coefficient can be no larger than a factor of ~4.5-21 times the Bohm diffusion coefficient if the velocity of the forward shock is in the range 2300-5000 km s-1. Since the coefficient is close to the Bohm limit, electrons are accelerated nearly as fast as possible in the regions where the critical frequency is about 1017 Hz.},

abstract = {Observational and theoretical evidence suggests that high-energy Galactic cosmic rays are primarily accelerated by supernova remnants. If also true for low-energy cosmic rays, the ionization rate near a supernova remnant should be higher than in the general Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). We have searched for H+ 3 absorption features in six sight lines which pass through molecular material near IC 443---a well-studied case of a supernova remnant interacting with its surrounding molecular material---for the purpose of inferring the cosmic-ray ionization rate in the region. In two of the sight lines (toward ALS 8828 and HD 254577) we find large H+ 3 column densities, N(H+ 3) ≈ 3 × 1014 cm-2, and deduce ionization rates of $\zeta$2 ≈ 2 × 10-15 s-1, about five times larger than inferred toward average diffuse molecular cloud sight lines. However, the 3$\sigma$ upper limits found for the other four sight lines are consistent with typical Galactic values. This wide range of ionization rates is likely the result of particle acceleration and propagation effects, which predict that the cosmic-ray spectrum and thus ionization rate should vary in and around the remnant. While we cannot determine if the H+ 3 absorption arises in post-shock (interior) or pre-shock (exterior) gas, the large inferred ionization rates suggest that IC 443 is in fact accelerating a large population of low-energy cosmic rays. Still, it is unclear whether this population can propagate far enough into the ISM to account for the ionization rate inferred in diffuse Galactic sight lines. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. Based in part on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.},

abstract = {Observations of H+ 3 in the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium have led to various surprising results, including the conclusion that the cosmic-ray ionization rate ($\zeta$2) is about one order of magnitude larger than previously thought. The present survey expands the sample of diffuse cloud sight lines with H+ 3 observations to 50, with detections in 21 of those. Ionization rates inferred from these observations are in the range (1.7 $\pm$ 1.3) × 10-16 s-1 < $\zeta$2 < (10.6 $\pm$ 8.2) × 10-16 s-1 with a mean value of $\zeta$2 = (3.5+5.3 -3.0) × 10-16 s-1. Upper limits (3$\sigma$) derived from non-detections of H+ 3 are as low as $\zeta$2 < 0.4 × 10-16 s-1. These low upper limits, in combination with the wide range of inferred cosmic-ray ionization rates, indicate variations in $\zeta$2 between different diffuse cloud sight lines. A study of $\zeta$2 versus N H (total hydrogen column density) shows that the two parameters are not correlated for diffuse molecular cloud sight lines, but that the ionization rate decreases when N H increases to values typical of dense molecular clouds. Both the difference in ionization rates between diffuse and dense clouds and the variation of $\zeta$2 among diffuse cloud sight lines are likely the result of particle propagation effects. The lower ionization rate in dense clouds is due to the inability of low-energy (few MeV) protons to penetrate such regions, while the ionization rate in diffuse clouds is controlled by the proximity of the observed cloud to a site of particle acceleration.},

abstract = {Over 100 trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions for masers associated with young, high-mass stars have been measured with the Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy Survey, a Very Long Baseline Array key science project, the European VLBI Network, and the Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry project. These measurements provide strong evidence for the existence of spiral arms in the Milky Way, accurately locating many arm segments and yielding spiral pitch angles ranging from about 7$\,^{\circ}$ to 20$\,^{\circ}$. The widths of spiral arms increase with distance from the Galactic center. Fitting axially symmetric models of the Milky Way with the three-dimensional position and velocity information and conservative priors for the solar and average source peculiar motions, we estimate the distance to the Galactic center, R 0, to be 8.34 $\pm$ 0.16 kpc, a circular rotation speed at the Sun, $\Theta$0, to be 240 $\pm$ 8 km s-1, and a rotation curve that is nearly flat (i.e., a slope of -0.2 $\pm$ 0.4 km s-1 kpc-1) between Galactocentric radii of ≈5 and 16 kpc. Assuming a "universal" spiral galaxy form for the rotation curve, we estimate the thin disk scale length to be 2.44 $\pm$ 0.16 kpc. With this large data set, the parameters R 0 and $\Theta$0 are no longer highly correlated and are relatively insensitive to different forms of the rotation curve. If one adopts a theoretically motivated prior that high-mass star forming regions are in nearly circular Galactic orbits, we estimate a global solar motion component in the direction of Galactic rotation, V ⊙ = 14.6 $\pm$ 5.0 km s-1. While $\Theta$0 and V ⊙ are significantly correlated, the sum of these parameters is well constrained, $\Theta$0 + V ⊙ = 255.2 $\pm$ 5.1 km s-1, as is the angular speed of the Sun in its orbit about the Galactic center, ($\Theta$0 + V ⊙)/R 0 = 30.57 $\pm$ 0.43 km s-1 kpc-1. These parameters improve the accuracy of estimates of the accelerations of the Sun and the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar in their Galactic orbits, significantly reducing the uncertainty in tests of gravitational radiation predicted by general relativity.},

abstract = {We have used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to search for 36 GHz and 44 GHz methanol (CH3OH) lines in a sample of 21 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs). Mainly the regions of the SNRs with 1720 MHz OH masers were observed. Despite the limited spatial extent covered in our search, methanol masers were detected in both G1.4-0.1 and W28. Additional masers were found in Sgr A East. More than 40 masers were found in G1.4-0.1, which we deduce are due to interactions between the SNR and at least two separate molecular clouds. The six masers in W28 are associated with the molecular cloud that is also associated with the OH maser excitation. We discuss the possibility that the methanol maser may be more numerous in SNRs than the OH maser, but harder to detect due to observational constraints.},

abstract = {We present the Chasing the Identification of ASCA Galactic Objects (ChIcAGO) survey, which is designed to identify the unknown X-ray sources discovered during the ASCA Galactic Plane Survey (AGPS). Little is known about most of the AGPS sources, especially those that emit primarily in hard X-rays (2-10 keV) within the Fx ~ 10-13 to 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1 X-ray flux range. In ChIcAGO, the subarcsecond localization capabilities of Chandra have been combined with a detailed multiwavelength follow-up program, with the ultimate goal of classifying the >100 unidentified sources in the AGPS. Overall to date, 93 unidentified AGPS sources have been observed with Chandra as part of the ChIcAGO survey. A total of 253 X-ray point sources have been detected in these Chandra observations within 3' of the original ASCA positions. We have identified infrared and optical counterparts to the majority of these sources, using both new observations and catalogs from existing Galactic plane surveys. X-ray and infrared population statistics for the X-ray point sources detected in the Chandra observations reveal that the primary populations of Galactic plane X-ray sources that emit in the Fx ~ 10-13 to 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1 flux range are active stellar coronae, massive stars with strong stellar winds that are possibly in colliding wind binaries, X-ray binaries, and magnetars. There is also another primary population that is still unidentified but, on the basis of its X-ray and infrared properties, likely comprises partly Galactic sources and partly active galactic nuclei.},

We find substantial variation in the electron temperature and absorbing column toward W49B, and we show that the mean metal abundances are consistent with the predicted yields in models of bipolar/jet-driven core-collapse SNe. Furthermore, we set strict upper limits on the X-ray luminosity of any undetected point sources, and we exclude the presence of a neutron star associated with W49B.

abstract = {Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) have been established as the most populous class of TeV $\gamma$-ray emitters. Since launch, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has identified five high-energy (100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray sources as PWNe and detected a large number of PWN candidates, all powered by young and energetic pulsars. The wealth of multi-wavelength data available and the new results provided by Fermi-LAT give us an opportunity to find new PWNe and to explore the radiative processes taking place in known ones. The TeV $\gamma$-ray unidentified (UNID) sources are the best candidates for finding new PWNe. Using 45 months of Fermi-LAT data for energies above 10 GeV, an analysis was performed near the position of 58 TeV PWNe and UNIDs within 5$\,^{\circ}$ of the Galactic plane to establish new constraints on PWN properties and find new clues on the nature of UNIDs. Of the 58 sources, 30 were detected, and this work provides their $\gamma$-ray fluxes for energies above 10 GeV. The spectral energy distributions and upper limits, in the multi-wavelength context, also provide new information on the source nature and can help distinguish between emission scenarios, i.e., between classification as a pulsar candidate or as a PWN candidate. Six new GeV PWN candidates are described in detail and compared with existing models. A population study of GeV PWN candidates as a function of the pulsar/PWN system characteristics is presented.},

We present XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray observations of the remnant that reveal a compact source at the tip of the radio PWN and complex structures that provide evidence for mixing of the supernova (SN) ejecta with PWN material following a reverse shock interaction. The X-ray spectra are well fitted by a non-thermal power-law model whose photon index steepens with distance from the presumed pulsar, and a thermal component with an average temperature of 0.55 keV. The enhanced abundances of silicon and sulfur in some regions, and the similar temperature and ionization timescale, suggest that much of the X-ray emission can be attributed to SN ejecta that have either been heated by the reverse shock or swept up by the PWN. We find one region with a lower temperature of 0.3 keV that appears to be in ionization equilibrium. Assuming the Sedov model, we derive a number of SNR properties, including an age of 16,500 yr. Modeling of the gamma-ray emission detected by Fermi shows that the emission may originate from the reverse shock-crushed PWN.},

abstract = {We present calculations of expected continuum emissions from Sedov-Taylor phase Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs), using the energy spectra of cosmic ray (CR) electrons and protons from non-linear diffusive shock acceleration simulations. A new, general-purpose radiative process code, COSMICP, was employed to calculate the radiation expected from CR electrons and protons and their secondary products. These radio, X-ray and gamma-ray emissions are generally consistent with current observations of Type Ia SNRs. The emissions from electrons in these models dominate the radio through X-ray bands. Decays of $\pi$0s from p-p collisions mostly dominate the gamma-ray range, although for a hot, low-density ISM case (nISM= 0.003 cm-3), the pion decay contribution is reduced sufficiently to reveal the inverse Compton contribution to TeV gamma-rays. In addition, we present simple scalings for the contributing emission processes to allow a crude exploration of model parameter space, enabling these results to be used more broadly. We also discuss the radial surface brightness profiles expected for these model SNRs in the X-ray and gamma-ray bands.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present new empirical radio surface-brightness-to-diameter ($\Sigma$-D) relations for supernova remnants (SNRs) in our Galaxy. We also present new theoretical derivations of the $\Sigma$-D relation based on equipartition or on a constant ratio between cosmic rays and magnetic field energy. A new calibration sample of 60 Galactic SNRs with independently determined distances is created. Instead of (standard) vertical regression, used in previous papers, different fitting procedures are applied to the calibration sample in the log $\Sigma$-log D plane. Non-standard regressions are used to satisfy the requirement that values of parameters obtained from the fitting of $\Sigma$-D and D-$\Sigma$ relations should be invariant within estimated uncertainties. We impose symmetry between $\Sigma$-D and D-$\Sigma$ due to the existence of large scatter in both D and $\Sigma$. Using four fitting methods that treat $\Sigma$ and D symmetrically, different $\Sigma$-D slopes $\beta$ are obtained for the calibration sample. Monte Carlo simulations verify that the slopes of the empirical $\Sigma$-D relation should be determined by using orthogonal regression because of its good performance in data sets with severe scatter. The slope derived here ($\beta$ = 4.8) is significantly steeper than those derived in previous studies. This new slope is closer to the updated theoretically predicted surface-brightness-diameter slope in the radio range of the Sedov phase. We also analyze the empirical $\Sigma$-D relations for SNRs in a dense environment of molecular clouds and for SNRs evolving in the lower-density interstellar medium. Applying new empirical relations to estimate distances of Galactic SNRs results in a dramatically changed distance scale.},

abstract = {The shocks of several young supernova remnants (SNR) are often associated with very thin optical filaments dominated by Balmer emission resulting from charge-exchange and collisional excitation between neutral Hydrogen from the interstellar medium and shocked protons and electrons. Optical lines are a direct probe of the conditions at the shock, in particular the width of the narrow and broad components reflect the temperature upstream and downstream of the shock, respectively. When the shock accelerate efficiently non-thermal particles, the shock structure changes producing anomalous Balmer lines and it is possible to use their line shape and their spatial profile to check the efficiency of SNR shocks in accelerating cosmic rays. Here we illustrate the kinetic theory of shock acceleration in presence of neutrals with some applications to young SNRs. We show that in three cases (RCW 86, SNR 0509-67.5 and Tycho) anomalous Balmer lines can be explained assuming that a fraction of $\sim 10\%$ of the total shock kinetic energy is converted into not thermal particles, while in one single case, the northwestern part of SN 1006, there is no evidence of efficient acceleration.},

The observations suggest a relatively young system expanding into a low-density region. Here, we present a study of MSH 11-62 using observations with the Chandra, XMM -Newton, and Fermi observatories, along with radio observations from the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We identify a compact X-ray source that appears to be the putative pulsar that powers the nebula, and show that the X-ray spectrum of the nebula bears the signature of synchrotron losses as particles diffuse into the outer nebula. Using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we identify $\gamma$-ray emission originating from MSH 11-62. With density constraints from the new X-ray measurements of the remnant, we model the evolution of the composite system in order to constrain the properties of the underlying pulsar and the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission.},

abstract = {In this work we study the individual contribution to diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from the secondary products in hadronic interactions generated by cosmic rays (CRs), in addition to the contribution of $\pi$0 decay via the decay mode $\pi$0 → 2$\gamma$. For that purpose we employ the Monte Carlo particle collision code DPMJET3.04 to determine the multiplicity spectra of various secondary particles with $\gamma$'s as the final decay state, that result from inelastic collisions between cosmic-ray protons and helium nuclei and the interstellar medium with standard composition. By combining the simulation results with a parametric model of $\gamma$-ray production by cosmic rays with energies below a few GeV, where DPMJET appears unreliable, we thus derive an easy-to-use $\gamma$-ray production matrix for cosmic rays with energies up to about 10 PeV. We apply the $\gamma$-ray production matrix to the GeV excess in diffuse galactic $\gamma$-rays observed by EGRET. Although the non-$\pi$0 decay components have contributed to the total emission with a different spectrum from the $\pi$0-decay component, they are insufficient to explain the GeV excess. We also test the hypothesis that the TeV-band $\gamma$-ray emission of the shell-type SNR RX J1713.7-3946 observed with HESS is caused by shock-accelerated hadronic cosmic rays. This scenario implies a very high efficacy of particle acceleration, so the particle spectrum is expected to continuously harden toward high energies on account of cosmic-ray modification of the shock. Using the $\chi$2 statistics we find that a continuously softening spectrum is strongly preferred, in contrast to expectations. A hardening spectrum has about 1% probability to explain the HESS data, but then only if a hard cut-off at 50 100 TeV is imposed on the particle spectrum.},

abstract = {Isolated neutron stars (INSs) were the first sources identified in the field of high-energy gamma-ray astronomy. In the 1970s, only two sources had been identified, the Crab and Vela pulsars. However, although few in number, these objects were crucial in establishing the very concept of a gamma-ray source. Moreover, they opened up significant discovery space in both the theoretical and phenomenological fronts. The need to explain the copious gamma-ray emission of these pulsars led to breakthrough developments in understanding the structure and physics of neutron star (NS) magnetospheres. In parallel, the 20-year-long chase to understand the nature of Geminga unveiled the existence of a radio-quiet, gamma-ray-emitting INS, adding a new dimension to the INS family. We are living through an extraordinary time of discovery. The current generation of gamma-ray detectors has vastly increased the population of known gamma-ray-emitting NSs. The 100 mark was crossed in 2011, and we are now over 150. The gamma-ray-emitting NS population exhibits roughly equal numbers of radio-loud and radio-quiet young INSs, plus an astonishing, and unexpected, group of isolated and binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs). The number of MSPs is growing so rapidly that they are on their way to becoming the most numerous members of the family of gamma-ray-emitting NSs. Even as these findings have set the stage for a revolution in our understanding of gamma-ray-emitting NSs, long-term monitoring of the gamma-ray sky has revealed evidence of flux variability in the Crab Nebula as well as in the pulsed emission from PSR J2021+4026, challenging a four-decades-old, constant-emission paradigm. Now we know that both pulsars and their nebulae can, indeed, display variable emission.},

abstract = {(Aims.) SNR RX J1713.7-3946 is perhaps one of the best observed shell-type supernova remnants with emissions dominated by energetic particles accelerated near the shock front. The nature of the TeV emission, however, is an issue still open to investigation. (Methods.) We carry out a systematic study of four lepton models for the TeV emission with the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. (Results.) It is shown that current data already give good constraints on the model parameters. Two commonly used parametric models do not appear to fit the observed radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray spectra. Models motivated by diffusive shock acceleration and by stochastic acceleration by compressive waves in the shock downstream give comparably good fits. The former has a sharper spectral cutoff in the hard X-ray band than the latter. Future observations with the HXMT and NuSTAR may distinguish these two models.},

abstract = {We are using the Very Long Baseline Array and the Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astronomy project to measure trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of masers found in high-mass star-forming regions across the Milky Way. Early results from 18 sources locate several spiral arms. The Perseus spiral arm has a pitch angle of 16$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 3$\,^{\circ}$, which favors four rather than two spiral arms for the Galaxy. Combining positions, distances, proper motions, and radial velocities yields complete three-dimensional kinematic information. We find that star-forming regions on average are orbiting the Galaxy ≈15 km s-1 slower than expected for circular orbits. By fitting the measurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the distance to the Galactic center R 0 = 8.4 $\pm$ 0.6 kpc and a circular rotation speed $\Theta$0 = 254 $\pm$ 16 km s-1. The ratio $\Theta$0/R 0 can be determined to higher accuracy than either parameter individually, and we find it to be 30.3 $\pm$ 0.9 km s-1 kpc-1, in good agreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper motion of Sgr A*. The data favor a rotation curve for the Galaxy that is nearly flat or slightly rising with Galactocentric distance. Kinematic distances are generally too large, sometimes by factors greater than 2; they can be brought into better agreement with the trigonometric parallaxes by increasing $\Theta$0/R 0 from the IAU recommended value of 25.9 km s-1 kpc-1 to a value near 30 km s-1 kpc-1. We offer a "revised" prescription for calculating kinematic distances and their uncertainties, as well as a new approach for defining Galactic coordinates. Finally, our estimates of $\Theta$0 and $\Theta$0/R 0, when coupled with direct estimates of R 0, provide evidence that the rotation curve of the Milky Way is similar to that of the Andromeda galaxy, suggesting that the dark matter halos of these two dominant Local Group galaxy are comparably massive.},

abstract = {In this work, we study theoretical and observational issues about pulsars (PSRs), pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). In particular, the spectral modeling of young PWNe and the X-ray analysis of SNRs with magnetars comparing their characteristics with those remnants surrounding canonical pulsars. The spectra of PWNe range from radio to $\gamma$-rays. They are the largest class of identified Galactic sources in $\gamma$-rays increasing the number from 1 to $\sim$30 during the last years. We have developed a detailed spectral code which reproduces the electromagnetic spectrum of PWNe in free expansion ($t_{age} \lesssim$10 kyr). We shed light and try to understand issues on time evolution of the spectra, the synchrotron self-Compton dominance in the Crab Nebula, the particle dominance in PWNe detected at TeV energies and how physical parameters constrain the detectability of PWNe at TeV. We make a systematic study of all Galactic, TeV-detected, young PWNe which allows to find correlations and trends between parameters. We also discuss about the spectrum of those PWNe not detected at TeV and if models with low magnetized nebulae can explain the lack of detection or, on the contrary, high-magnetization models are more favorable. Regarding the X-ray analysis of SNRs, we use X-ray spectroscopy in SNRs with magnetars to discuss about the formation mechanism of such extremely magnetized PSRs. The alpha-dynamo mechanism proposed in the 1990's produces an energy release that should have influence in the energy of the SN explosion. We extend the work done previously done by \cite{vink06} about the energetics of the SN explosion looking for this energy release and we look for the element ionization and the X-ray luminosity and we compare our results with other SNRs with an associated central source.},

However the last few years have seen an upsurge in the observation, progress in the theory and a genuine increase in the importance attached to the topic due to its intimate connection to the indirect detection of evidence for dark matter. The intent of this talk is to set the stage for the meeting by reviewing some of the basic features of the entire cosmic ray spectrum from GeV to ZeV energy and some of the models that have been developed. The connection will also be made to recent developments in understanding general astrophysical particle acceleration in pulsar wind nebulae, relativistic jets and gamma ray bursts. The prospects for future discoveries, which may elucidate the origin of cosmic rays, are bright.},

In a CO longitude-velocity map at b=0deg the far 3 kpc arm can be followed over at least 20deg of Galactic longitude as a faint lane at positive velocities running parallel to the near arm. The far arm crosses l=0deg at +56 km s-1, quite symmetric with the -53 km s-1 expansion velocity of the near arm. In addition to their symmetry in longitude and velocity, we find that the two arms have line widths (~21 km s-1), linear scale heights (~103 pc FWHM), and H2 masses per unit length (~4.3 × 106 Msolar kpc-1) that agree to 26% or better. Guided by the CO, we have also identified the far arm in high-resolution 21 cm data and find, subject to the poorly known CO-to-H2 ratio in these objects, that both arms are predominately molecular by a factor of 3-4. The detection of these symmetric expanding arms provides strong support for the existence of a bar at the center of our Galaxy and should allow better determination of the bar's physical properties.},

The sample of supernova remnants (SNRs) detected at gamma-ray energies is now much larger: it goes from evolved supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds up to young shell-type supernova remnants and historical supernova remnants. Studies of SNRs are of great interest, as these analyses are directly linked to the long standing issue of the origin of the Galactic cosmic rays. In this context, pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) need also to be considered since they evolve in conjunction with SNRs. As a result, they frequently complicate interpretation of the gamma-ray emission seen from SNRs and they could also contribute directly to the local cosmic ray spectrum, particularly the leptonic component. This paper reviews the current results and thinking on SNRs and PWNe and their connection to cosmic ray production.},

abstract = {High resolution and sensitivity large-scale radio surveys of the Milky Way are critical in the discovery of very low surface brightness supernova remnants (SNRs), which may constitute a significant portion of the Galactic SNRs still unaccounted for (ostensibly the Missing SNR problem). The overall purpose here is to present the results of a systematic, deep data-mining of the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) for faint, extended non-thermal and polarized emission structures that are likely the shells of uncatalogued supernova remnants. We examine 5$\times$5 degree mosaics from the entire 1420 MHz continuum and polarization dataset of the CGPS after removing unresolved point sources and subsequently smoothing them. Newly revealed extended emission objects are compared to similarly-prepared CGPS 408 MHz continuum mosaics, as well as to source-removed mosaics from various existing radio surveys at 4.8 GHz, 2.7 GHz, and 327 MHz, to identify candidates with non-thermal emission characteristics. We integrate flux densities at each frequency to characterise the radio spectra behaviour of these candidates. We further look for mid- and high-frequency (1420 MHz, 4.8 GHz) ordered polarized emission from the limb brightened shell-like continuum features that the candidates sport. Finally, we use IR and optical maps to provide additional backing evidence. Here we present evidence that five new objects, identified as filling all or some of the criteria above, are strong candidates for new SNRs. These five are designated by their Galactic coordinate names G108.5+11.0, G128.5+2.6, G149.5+3.2, G150.8+3.8, and G160.1$-$1.1. These discoveries represent a significant increase in the number of SNRs known in the outer Galaxy second quadrant of longitude (90$^{\circ} \leq \ell \leq $180$^{\circ}$).},

abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs), as the major contributors to the galactic cosmic rays (CRs), are believed to maintain an average CR spectrum by diffusive shock acceleration regardless of the way they release CRs into the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the interaction of the CRs with nearby gas clouds crucially depends on the release mechanism. We call into question two aspects of a popular paradigm of the CR injection into the ISM, according to which they passively and isotropically diffuse in the prescribed magnetic fluctuations as test particles. First, we treat the escaping CR and the Alfv{\'e}n waves excited by them on an equal footing. Second, we adopt field-aligned CR escape outside the source, where the waves become weak. An exact analytic self-similar solution for a CR "cloud" released by a dimmed accelerator strongly deviates from the test-particle result. The normalized CR partial pressure may be approximated as {P}(p,z,t)=2[|z|^{5/3}+z_{dif}^{5/3}(p,t)]^{-3/5}\exp [-z^{2}/4D_{ISM}(p)t], where p is the momentum of CR particle, and z is directed along the field. The core of the cloud expands as z_{dif}\propto \sqrt{D_{NL}\left(p\right)t} and decays in time as {P}\propto 2z_{dif}^{-1}\left(t\right). The diffusion coefficient D NL is strongly suppressed compared to its background ISM value D ISM: D NL ~ D ISMexp (- $\Pi$) Lt D ISM for sufficiently high field-line-integrated CR partial pressure, $\Pi$. When $\Pi$ Gt 1, the CRs drive Alfv{\'e}n waves efficiently enough to build a transport barrier ( {P}\approx 2/\left|z\right|---"pedestal") that strongly reduces the leakage. The solution has a spectral break at p = p br, where p br satisfies the equation D NL(p br) ~= z 2/t.},

abstract = {Maser emission from the 1720-MHz transition of hydroxyl(OH) has identified shock interactions in 10% of all supernova remnants(SNRs). Such maser-emitting SNRs are also bright in molecular line emission. Though somewhat rare, SNRs interacting with dense molecular clouds are an important class in which to study cosmic ray acceleration, SNR evolution, and effects on the energetics and chemistry of the interstellar medium. To study molecular shocks via a multiwavelength approach, the VLA, GBT, Spitzer Space Telescope have been used in the following ways: (i) With the GBT widespread OH(1720 MHz) emission and absorption in other OH lines is observed across the interaction site. Observations of all four ground-state transitions at 1720, 1667/5 and 1612 MHz allows us to model OH excitation, yielding the temperature, density and OH abundance in the post-shock gas. Maser emission is found to have a higher flux density with the GBT than with high-resolution VLA observations for 10 of 15 observed remnants, suggesting maser emission is present on large spatial scales. (ii) Sensitive VLA observations of select SNRs (W44, IC 443, Kes 69, 3C 391, G357.7+0.3) reveal the nature of enhanced 1720 MHz emission. Numerous weak compact masers as well as diffuse extended emission are detected tracing the shock-front. Zeeman splitting of masers permits the post-shock magnetic field strength and the line of sight field direction to be directly measured. (iii) Rotational lines of molecular hydrogen are detected at the position of several masers with Spitzer IRS spectroscopy between 5 and 35 mm. Excitation of the hydrogen lines requires the passage of a C-type shock through dense molecular gas, in agreement with the conditions derived from OH excitation. The presence of bright ionic lines requires multiple shocks present at the interaction site. (iv) A new survey for SNR-masers has identified four new interacting SNRs within 10 degrees of the Galactic Center. Maser-emitting SNRs are found to be preferentially distributed in the inner Galaxy, and preferentially associated with gamma-ray sources. To date, nine remnants with TeV or GeV-energy coincidences also harbor OH(1720 MHz) masers, making this signpost of interaction a potential signpost of cosmic-ray acceleration as well. The enhanced local cosmic ray density is a viable mechanism to produce the high columns of OH which are observed in these sources.},

abstract = {In the past twenty years, the reconnaissance of 12CO and 13CO emission in the Milky Way by single-dish millimeter-wave telescopes has expanded our view and understanding of interstellar molecular gas. We enumerate the major surveys of CO emission along the Galactic plane and summarize the various approaches that leverage these data to determine the large-scale distribution of molecular gas: its radial and vertical distributions, its concentration into clouds, and its relationship to spiral structure. The integrated properties of molecular clouds are compiled from catalogs derived from the CO surveys using uniform assumptions regarding the Galactic rotation curve, solar radius, and the CO-to-H2 conversion factor. We discuss the radial variations of cloud surface brightness, the distributions of cloud mass and size, and scaling relations between velocity dispersion, cloud size, and surface density that affirm that the larger clouds are gravitationally bound. Measures of density structure and gas kinematics within nearby, well-resolved clouds are examined and attributed to the effects of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We review the arguments for short, intermediate, and long molecular lifetimes based on the observational record. The review concludes with questions that shall require further observational attention.},

abstract = {Cosmic-ray astrophysics has advanced rapidly in recent years, and its impact on other astronomical disciplines has broadened. Many new experiments measuring these particles, both directly in the atmosphere or space and indirectly via {\^I}³ rays and synchrotron radiation, have widened the range and quality of the information available on their origin, propagation, and interactions. The impact of low-energy cosmic rays on interstellar chemistry is a fast-developing topic, including the propagation of these particles into the clouds in which the chemistry occurs. Cosmic rays, via their {\^I}³-ray production, also provide a powerful way to probe the gas content of the interstellar medium. Substantial advances have been made in the observations and modelling of the interplay between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium. Focusing on energies up to 1 TeV, these interrelating aspects are covered at various levels of detail, giving a guide to the state of the subject.},

The region studied (l = 100$\,^{\circ}$ to 130$\,^{\circ}$, b = -5$\,^{\circ}$ to +32$\,^{\circ}$) contains the prominent local clouds of the Cepheus and Polaris flares and the molecular cloud complex associated with Cas A and NGC 7538, the largest in the Perseus arm. Gas along the line of sight is partitioned into three distance ranges. The gamma-ray emissivity and N(H2)/WCO ratio in the local range are found to be (1.84$\pm$0.10) x 10-26 s-1sr-1 and (0.92$\pm$0.14) x 1020 cm-2 (K km s-1)-1, respectively, both derived for the energy range E > 100 MeV. In the Perseus arm, these quantities are (1.11$\pm$0.09) x 10-26 s-1 sr-1 and (2.5$\pm$0.9) x 1020 (K km s-1)-1. The decrease of emissivity from the solar circle to the Perseus arm is significant, although the variation of N(H2)/WCO is not. No significant variations of these quantities within each distance range are found. The gamma-ray emissivity in the Perseus arm is much less than predicted by models that assume a simple coupling between cosmic-ray density and surface density of interstellar gas. The derived emissivity in the Perseus arm constrains the amount of molecular gas not detected in CO to be at most one-tenth the amount of atomic hydrogen. A bright, soft spectrum gamma-ray source in this field reported from analysis of COS B data is not seen by EGRET. The spectrum of the extragalactic isotropic emission toward Cepheus is consistent with findings from other regions that have been studied with EGRET data.},

The bright molecular emission in the W3 region in the Perseus arm is prominent, and little emission is seen at greater Galactocentric distances. The extensive local emission in the survey contains the large molecular cloud complex associated with Cam OB1. Between the local and Perseus arm emission, a nearly empty gap in velocity is seen across the entire longitude range. On the assumptions that the kinematically derived width of the gap is the true width and that the X ratio is constant, the arm-interarm contrast of CO is ≥ 25:1 in surface density. A few clouds are detected beyond the Perseus arm, and only one cloud, already known, is detected at extreme Galactocentric distances, beyond the Perseus and outer arms. The cumulative mass distribution of the clouds in the Perseus arm has power-law index 065$\pm$0.15 and the clouds there are systematically less luminous in CO by a factor 3.5$\pm$2 than clouds near the solar circle. The distribution of molecular gas with Galactocentric distance in the outer Galaxy is compared with that of luminous Infrared Astronomy Satellite point sources that trace massive star-forming regions. The agreement is generally good, with evidence for enhanced star formation relative to the surface density of molecular gas in the W3 region and perhaps also in the outer arm.},

The derived source-count distribution is consistent with the distribution found by the Fermi collaboration based on the first Fermi point source catalogue. In particular, we find that the contribution of resolved and unresolved active galactic nuclei (AGN) to the total gamma-ray flux is below 20% - 25%. In the best fit model, the AGN-like point source fraction is 17% +- 2%. Using the fact that the Galactic emission varies across the sky while the extra-galactic diffuse emission is isotropic, we put a lower limit of 51% on Galactic diffuse emission and an upper limit of 32% on the contribution from extra-galactic weak sources, such as star-forming galaxies. Possible systematic uncertainties are discussed.

We have developed a method to explore some systematic effects on SNRs' properties caused by interstellar emission modeling. We created eight alternative Galactic interstellar models by varying a few input parameters to GALPROP, namely the height of the cosmic ray propagation halo, cosmic ray source distribution in the Galaxy, and atomic hydrogen spin temperature. We have analyzed eight representative candidate SNRs chosen to encompass a range of Galactic locations, extensions, and spectral properties using the eight different interstellar emission models. The models were fitted to the LAT data with free independent normalization coefficients for the various components of the model along the line of sight in each region of interest. We will discuss the results and compare them with those obtained with the official LAT interstellar emission model.},

abstract = {The study of the gamma-ray radiation produced by cosmic rays that escape their accelerators is of paramount importance for (at least) two reasons: first, the detection of those gamma-ray photons can serve to identify the sources of cosmic rays and, second, the characteristics of that radiation give us constraints on the way in which cosmic rays propagate in the interstellar medium.

abstract = {The ultimate goal of the observation of nonthermal emission from astrophysical sources is to understand the underlying particle acceleration and evolution processes, and few tools are publicly available to infer the particle distribution properties from the observed photon spectra from X-ray to VHE gamma rays. Here I present naima, an open source Python package that provides models for nonthermal radiative emission from homogeneous distribution of relativistic electrons and protons. Contributions from synchrotron, inverse Compton, nonthermal bremsstrahlung, and neutral-pion decay can be computed for a series of functional shapes of the particle energy distributions, with the possibility of using user-defined particle distribution functions. In addition, naima provides a set of functions that allow to use these models to fit observed nonthermal spectra through an MCMC procedure, obtaining probability distribution functions for the particle distribution parameters. Here I present the models and methods available in naima and an example of their application to the understanding of a galactic nonthermal source. naima's documentation, including how to install the package, is available at http://naima.readthedocs.org.},

abstract = {We present Brut, an algorithm to identify bubbles in infrared images of the Galactic midplane. Brut is based on the Random Forest algorithm, and uses bubbles identified by >35,000 citizen scientists from the Milky Way Project to discover the identifying characteristics of bubbles in images from the Spitzer Space Telescope. We demonstrate that Brut's ability to identify bubbles is comparable to expert astronomers. We use Brut to re-assess the bubbles in the Milky Way Project catalog, and find that 10%-30% of the objects in this catalog are non-bubble interlopers. Relative to these interlopers, high-reliability bubbles are more confined to the mid-plane, and display a stronger excess of young stellar objects along and within bubble rims. Furthermore, Brut is able to discover bubbles missed by previous searches---particularly bubbles near bright sources which have low contrast relative to their surroundings. Brut demonstrates the synergies that exist between citizen scientists, professional scientists, and machine learning techniques. In cases where "untrained" citizens can identify patterns that machines cannot detect without training, machine learning algorithms like Brut can use the output of citizen science projects as input training sets, offering tremendous opportunities to speed the pace of scientific discovery. A hybrid model of machine learning combined with crowdsourced training data from citizen scientists can not only classify large quantities of data, but also address the weakness of each approach if deployed alone.},

abstract = {This catalog summarizes 117 high-confidence >=0.1 GeV gamma-ray pulsar detections using three years of data acquired by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi satellite. Half are neutron stars discovered using LAT data through periodicity searches in gamma-ray and radio data around LAT unassociated source positions. The 117 pulsars are evenly divided into three groups: millisecond pulsars, young radio-loud pulsars, and young radio-quiet pulsars. We characterize the pulse profiles and energy spectra and derive luminosities when distance information exists. Spectral analysis of the off-peak phase intervals indicates probable pulsar wind nebula emission for four pulsars, and off-peak magnetospheric emission for several young and millisecond pulsars. We compare the gamma-ray properties with those in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands. We provide flux limits for pulsars with no observed gamma-ray emission, highlighting a small number of gamma-faint, radio-loud pulsars. The large, varied gamma-ray pulsar sample constrains emission models. Fermi's selection biases complement those of radio surveys, enhancing comparisons with predicted population distributions.},

We have separated clouds in velocity in HI and CO emission and modelled the 0.4-100 GeV intensity, the dust optical depth at 353 GHz, the thermal radiance of the large grains, and an estimate of the dust extinction empirically corrected for the starlight intensity, $A_{VQ}$. The gamma-ray emissivity spectra confirm that the GeV-TeV cosmic rays uniformly permeate all gas phases up to the CO cores. The dust and cosmic rays reveal large amounts of DNM gas, with comparable spatial distributions and twice as much mass as in the CO-bright clouds. We give constraints on the HI-DNM-CO transitions and CO-dark $H_2$ fractions for separate clouds. The corrected extinction provides the best fit to the total gas traced by the gamma rays, but we find evidence for a rise in $A_{VQ}/N_H$ and a steep rise in opacity, with increasing $N_H$ and $H_2$ fraction, and with decreasing dust temperature. We observe less variations for the specific power of the grains, except for a decline by half in the CO cores. This combined information suggests grain evolution. The gamma rays and dust radiance yield consistent $X_{CO}$ estimates near $0.7\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km/s)$^{-1}$. The other dust tracers yield biased values because of the grain opacity rise in the CO clouds. These results also confirm a factor of 2 difference between $X_{CO}$ estimates at pc and kpc scales.},

abstract = {We present a detailed investigation of the $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity of the supernova remnant (SNR) W28 (G6.4-0.1) observed by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We detected significant $\gamma$-ray emission spatially coincident with TeV sources HESS J1800-240A, B, and C, located outside the radio boundary of the SNR. Their spectra in the 2-100 GeV band are consistent with the extrapolation of the power-law spectra of the TeV sources. We also identified a new source of GeV emission, dubbed Source W, which lies outside the boundary of TeV sources and coincides with radio emission from the western part of W28. All of the GeV $\gamma$-ray sources overlap with molecular clouds in the velocity range from 0 to 20 km s-1. Under the assumption that the $\gamma$-ray emission toward HESS J1800-240A, B, and C comes from $\pi$0 decay due to the interaction between the molecular clouds and cosmic rays (CRs) escaping from W28, they can be naturally explained by a single model in which the CR diffusion coefficient is smaller than the theoretical expectation in the interstellar space. The total energy of the CRs escaping from W28 is constrained through the same modeling to be larger than ~2 × 1049 erg. The emission from Source W can also be explained with the same CR escape scenario.},

abstract = {The Fermi bubbles are two large structures in the gamma-ray sky extending to 55$\,^{\circ}$ above and below the Galactic center. We analyze 50 months of Fermi Large Area Telescope data between 100 MeV and 500 GeV above 10$\,^{\circ}$ in Galactic latitude to derive the spectrum and morphology of the Fermi bubbles. We thoroughly explore the systematic uncertainties that arise when modeling the Galactic diffuse emission through two separate approaches. The gamma-ray spectrum is well described by either a log parabola or a power law with an exponential cutoff. We exclude a simple power law with more than 7$\sigma$ significance. The power law with an exponential cutoff has an index of 1.9 $\pm$ 0.2 and a cutoff energy of 110 $\pm$ 50 GeV. We find that the gamma-ray luminosity of the bubbles is 4.4^{+2.4}_{-0.9} \times 10^{37} erg s-1. We confirm a significant enhancement of gamma-ray emission in the southeastern part of the bubbles, but we do not find significant evidence for a jet. No significant variation of the spectrum across the bubbles is detected. The width of the boundary of the bubbles is estimated to be 3.4^{+3.7}_{-2.6} deg. Both inverse Compton (IC) models and hadronic models including IC emission from secondary leptons fit the gamma-ray data well. In the IC scenario, synchrotron emission from the same population of electrons can also explain the WMAP and Planck microwave haze with a magnetic field between 5 and 20 $\mu$G.},

abstract = {This thesis has two parts, the first focusing on analysis and modeling of high-energy pulsar emission and the second on pulsar observations. In part 1, I constrain the magnetospheric emission geometry (magnetic inclination alpha, emission width w, maximum emission radius r, and observer colatitude zeta) by modeling >100 MeV light curves of four bright gamma-ray pulsars with geometrical representations of the slot gap and outer gap emission models. I also model the >100 MeV phase resolved spectra, measuring the power law cutoff energy Ec with phase. Assuming curvature radiation reaction (CRR) is the dominant emission process, I use Ec to compute the accelerating electric field strength, E||. The original contributions of this thesis to astrophysical research are the use of the force-free magnetic field solution in light curve modeling, the inclusion of an offset polar cap in the slot gap geometry, and the calculation of E|| from observationally determined quantities (i.e., Ec). The simulations reproduce observed light curve features and accurately match multi-wavelength zeta measurements, but the specific combination of best-fit emission and field geometry varies between pulsars. Perhaps pulsar magnetospheres contain some combination of slot gap and outer gap geometries, whose contributions to the light curve depend on viewing angle. The requirement that, locally, E||/B < 1 rules out the vacuum field as a valid approximation to the true pulsar field under the CRR assumption. The E|| values imply that the youngest, most energetic pulsar has a near-force-free field, and that CRR and/or narrow acceleration gaps may not be applicable to older pulsars. In part 2, I present discoveries of two radio millisecond pulsars (MSPs) from LAT-guided pulsar searches. I timed the first MSP, resulting in the detection of gamma-ray pulsations. The second MSP is in a globular cluster. My initial timing efforts show that it is in a highly eccentric ( e ~ 0.95) binary orbit with a massive (>0.7Msun) companion, suggestive of past companion exchanges and an exotic nature of the current companion. Further timing will yield a measurement of the orbital precession rate and the system mass, yielding neutron star mass constraints.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the GeV gamma-ray emission toward the supernova remnant (SNR) G8.7-0.1 with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. An investigation of the relationship between G8.7-0.1 and the TeV unidentified source HESS J1804-216 provides us with an important clue on diffusion process of cosmic rays if particle acceleration operates in the SNR. The GeV gamma-ray emission is extended with most of the emission in positional coincidence with the SNR G8.7-0.1 and a lesser part located outside the western boundary of G8.7-0.1. The region of the gamma-ray emission overlaps spatially connected molecular clouds, implying a physical connection for the gamma-ray structure. The total gamma-ray spectrum measured with LAT from 200 MeV-100 GeV can be described by a broken power-law function with a break of 2.4 $\pm$ 0.6 (stat) $\pm$ 1.2 (sys) GeV, and photon indices of 2.10 $\pm$ 0.06 (stat) $\pm$ 0.10 (sys) below the break and 2.70 $\pm$ 0.12 (stat) $\pm$ 0.14 (sys) above the break. Given the spatial association among the gamma rays, the radio emission of G8.7-0.1, and the molecular clouds, the decay of $\pi$0s produced by particles accelerated in the SNR and hitting the molecular clouds naturally explains the GeV gamma-ray spectrum. We also find that the GeV morphology is not well represented by the TeV emission from HESS J1804-216 and that the spectrum in the GeV band is not consistent with the extrapolation of the TeV gamma-ray spectrum. The spectral index of the TeV emission is consistent with the particle spectral index predicted by a theory that assumes energy-dependent diffusion of particles accelerated in an SNR. We discuss the possibility that the TeV spectrum originates from the interaction of particles accelerated in G8.7-0.1 with molecular clouds, and we constrain the diffusion coefficient of the particles.},

A simple criterion is derived to decide whether the Li and Ma method can be applied in the presence of systematic errors. An alternative method is discussed for cases where systematic errors are too large for the application of the original Li and Ma method. This alternative method reduces to the Li and Ma method when systematic errors are negligible. Finally, it is shown that the consideration of systematic errors will be important in many analyses of data from the planned Cherenkov Telescope Array.},

abstract = {CO line emission represents the most accessible and widely used tracer of the molecular ISM. This renders the translation of observed CO intensity into total H2 gas mass critical to understanding star formation and the ISM in our Galaxy and beyond. We review the theoretical underpinning, techniques, and results of efforts to estimate this CO-to-H2 ``conversion factor,'' XCO, in different environments. In the Milky Way disk, we recommend a conversion factor of [Formula: see text] cm-2 (K km s-1)-1 with $\pm$30% uncertainty. Studies of other ``normal galaxies'' return similar values in Milky Way-like disks, but with greater scatter and systematic uncertainty. Departures from this Galactic conversion factor are both observed and expected. Dust-based determinations, theoretical arguments, and scaling relations all suggest that XCO increases with decreasing metallicity, turning up sharply below metallicity ˜1/3-1/2 solar in a manner consistent with model predictions that identify shielding as a key parameter. Based on spectral line modeling and dust observations, XCO appears to drop in the central, bright regions of some but not all galaxies, often coincident with regions of bright CO emission and high stellar surface density. This lower XCO is also present in the overwhelmingly molecular ISM of starburst galaxies, where several lines of evidence point to a lower CO-to-H2 conversion factor. At high redshift, direct evidence regarding the conversion factor remains scarce; we review what is known based on dynamical modeling and other arguments.},

abstract = {We present the analysis of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) $\gamma$-ray observations of HB 21, a mixed-morphology supernova remnant. Such supernova remnants are characterized by an interior thermal X-ray plasma, surrounded by a wider nonthermal shell emitting at radio frequencies. HB 21 has a large angular size, making it a good candidate for detailed morphological and spectral studies with the LAT. The radio extension is 2{\deg}x1{\deg}.5, compared to the LAT 68% containment angle of ~1{\deg} at 1 GeV. To understand the origin of $\gamma$-ray emission, we compare LAT observations with other wavelengths that trace non-thermal radio synchrotron, nearby molecular clouds, shocked molecular clumps, and the central X-ray plasma. Finally, we model possible hadronic and leptonic emission mechanisms. We conclude that $\gamma$-rays from HB 21 are likely the result of electron bremsstrahlung or proton-proton collisions with dense material due to interaction with the nearby clouds.},

Recent determinations of the pulsar distribution have made the discrepancy even more apparent. The problem is shown to be plausibly solved by a variation in the WCO-to-N(H2) scaling factor. If this factor increases by a factor of 5-10 from the inner to the outer Galaxy, as expected from the Galactic metallicity gradient, we show that the source distribution required to match the radial gradient of $\gamma$-rays can be reconciled with the distribution of supernova remnants as traced by current studies of pulsars. The resulting model fits the EGRET $\gamma$-ray profiles extremely well in longitude, and reproduces the mid-latitude inner Galaxy intensities better than previous models.},

abstract = {Hypothesis tests for the presence of new sources of Poisson counts amidst background processes are frequently performed in high energy physics (HEP), gamma ray astronomy (GRA), and other branches of science. While there are conceptual issues already when the mean rate of background is precisely known, the issues are even more difficult when the mean background rate has non-negligible uncertainty. After describing a variety of methods to be found in the HEP and GRA literature, we consider in detail three classes of algorithms and evaluate them over a wide range of parameter space, by the criterion of how close the ensemble-average Type I error rate (rejection of the background-only hypothesis when it is true) compares with the nominal significance level given by the algorithm. We recommend wider use of an algorithm firmly grounded in frequentist tests of the ratio of Poisson means, although for very low counts the over-coverage can be severe due to the effect of discreteness. We extend the studies of Cranmer, who found that a popular Bayesian-frequentist hybrid can undercover severely when taken to high Z values. We also examine the profile likelihood method, which has long been used in GRA and HEP; it provides an excellent approximation in much of the parameter space, as previously studied by Rolke and collaborators.

abstract = {We report the discovery of an unidentified, extended source of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission, VER J2019+407, within the radio shell of the supernova remnant SNR G78.2+2.1, using 21.4 hours of data taken by the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory in 2009. These data confirm the preliminary indications of gamma-ray emission previously seen in a two-year (2007-2009) blind survey of the Cygnus region by VERITAS. VER J2019+407, which is detected at a post-trials significance of 7.5 standard deviations in the 2009 data, is localized to the northwestern rim of the remnant in a region of enhanced radio and X-ray emission. It has an intrinsic extent of 0.23^{\circ} \pm 0.03^{\circ} (stat)+0.04^{\circ}_{-0.02}^{\circ}(sys) and its spectrum is well-characterized by a differential power law (dN/dE = N_0 \times (E/TeV)^{-\Gamma}) with a photon index of $\Gamma$ = 2.37 \pm 0.14 (stat) \pm 0.20 (sys) and a flux normalization of N0 = 1.5 \pm 0.2 (stat) \pm 0.4(sys) \times 10^-12 ph TeV^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. This yields an integral flux of 5.2 \pm 0.8 (stat) \pm 1.4 (sys) \times 10^-12 ph cm^{-2} s^{-1} above 320 GeV, corresponding to 3.7% of the Crab Nebula flux. We consider the relationship of the TeV gamma-ray emission with the GeV gamma-ray emission seen from SNR G78.2+2.1 as well as that seen from a nearby cocoon of freshly accelerated cosmic rays. Multiple scenarios are considered as possible origins for the TeV gamma-ray emission, including hadronic particle acceleration at the supernova remnant shock.},

abstract = {We study the capability of low-energy cosmic rays (CR) to penetrate into diffuse clouds when they move from the hot ionized plasma to a cool cloud embedded in that plasma. The spectrum of CR inside a cloud can be remarkably different from the the one present in the hot interstellar medium because when CRs pass through a dense cloud of matter, they suffer energy losses due to ionization and nuclear interactions. Hence there is a net flux of CRs towards the cloud that can excite Alfv\'en waves. In turn, self-excited Alfv\'en waves enhances the diffusion of CRs near the edge of the cloud, forcing CRs to spend more time in this layer and increasing the amount of energy losses. The final effect is that the flux of CR entering into the cloud is strongly suppressed below an energy threshold whose value depends on ambient parameters. For the first time we use the full kinetic theory to describe this problem, coupling CRs and Alfv\'en waves through the streaming instability, and including the damping of the waves due to ion-neutral friction and the CR energy losses due to ionization and pion production. Differently from previous approaches, this method allow us to describe the full CR spectrum and the magnetic turbulence spectrum in the transition region between hot interstellar medium and the cloud. For the typical size and density of diffuse clouds in the Galaxy, we find that the flux of particles entering the cloud is strongly reduced below E~10-100 MeV, while for larger energies the CR spectrum remain unaltered.},

abstract = {Recent gamma ray observations show that middle aged supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds can be sources of both GeV and TeV emission. Models involving re-acceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays in the ambient medium and direct interaction between supernova remnant and molecular clouds have been proposed to explain the observed gamma ray emission. For the re-acceleration process, standard DSA theory in the test particle limit produces a steady state particle spectrum that is too flat compared to observations, which suggests that the high energy part of the observed spectrum has not yet reached a steady state. We derive a time dependent DSA solution in the test particle limit for situations involving re-acceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays in the preshock medium. Simple estimates with our time dependent DSA solution plus a molecular cloud interaction model can reproduce the overall shape of the spectra of IC 443 and W44 from GeV to TeV energies through pure $\pi^0$-decay emission. We allow for a power law momentum dependence of the diffusion coefficient, finding that a power law index of 0.5 is favored.},

These studies are also crucial for understanding the physics of supernovae, their cosmological implication, and the origin of galactic cosmic rays. The unique capabilities of Athena+ will allow us to explore a new parameter space. Spatially-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy using Athena+ X-IFU of young remnants will allow to characterize individual parcels of ejected material in the line of sight in terms of kinematics, ionization and composition, providing access to the three dimensional geometry of the explosion. Athena+ will also allow studying shock physics and particle acceleration in supernova remnants, as well as their interaction with their environment. Athena+ X-IFU will also characterize the ionization mechanisms competing in forming the complex structures of the hot interstellar medium, likely to keep the echo of past star formation activity, both in our Galaxy and nearby ones. For the first time the dust and gas of the densest cold medium, like in the Galactic Centre environment, will be studied. Athena+ X-IFU will observe, along with the Mg K and Si K edges, which are the main tracers of the silicates content of the ISM, the Fe K edge with unprecedented sensitivity and energy-resolution. This will allow us to study for the first time the nature of Fe-bearing dust in such regions.},

abstract = {Determination of the explosion type of supernova remnants (SNRs) can be challenging, as SNRs are hundreds to thousands of years old and supernovae (SNe) are classified based on spectral properties days after explosion. Previous studies of thermal X-ray emission from Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SNRs have shown that Type Ia and core-collapse (CC) SNRs have statistically different symmetries, and thus these sources can be typed based on their X-ray morphologies. In this paper, we extend the same technique, a multipole expansion technique using power ratios, to infrared (IR) images of SNRs to test whether they can be typed using the symmetry of their warm dust emission as well. We analyzed archival Spitzer Space Telescope Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) 24 micron observations of the previously used X-ray sample, and we find that the two classes of SNRs separate according to their IR morphologies. The Type Ia SNRs are statistically more circular and mirror symmetric than the CC SNRs, likely due to the different circumstellar environments and explosion geometries of the progenitors. Broadly, our work indicates that the IR emission retains information of the explosive origins of the SNR and offers a new method to type SNRs based on IR morphology.},

abstract = {Westerlund 1 (Wd 1) is the most massive stellar cluster in the Galaxy and associated with an extended region of TeV emission. Here we report the results of a search for GeV \gamma-ray emission in this region. The analysis is based on ~4.5 years of Fermi-LAT data and reveals significantly extended emission which we model as a Gaussian, resulting in a best-fit sigma of \sigma_S = (0.475 +/- 0.05) deg and an offset from Wd 1 of ~1 deg. A partial overlap of the GeV emission with the TeV signal as reported by H.E.S.S. is found. We investigate the spectral and morphological characteristics of the \gamma-ray emission and discuss its origin in the context of two distinct scenarios. Acceleration of electrons in a Pulsar Wind Nebula provides a reasonably natural interpretation of the GeV emission, but leaves the TeV emission unexplained. A scenario in which protons are accelerated in or near Wd 1 in supernova explosion(s) and are diffusing away and interacting with molecular material, seems consistent with the observed GeV and TeV emission, but requires a very high energy input in protons, ~10^51 erg, and rather slow diffusion. Observations of Wd 1 with a future \gamma-ray detector such as CTA provide a very promising route to fully resolve the origin of the TeV and GeV emission in Wd 1 and provide a deeper understanding of the high-energy (HE) astrophysics of massive stellar clusters.},

abstract = {We present the results of a new high-resolution study of the molecular gas associated with the supernova remnants (SNRs) G349.7+0.2 and G18.8+0.3. The observations were performed with the SEST telescope in the 12CO J = 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 lines (beams of 45'', 23'' and 15'', respectively). The present observations have provided, for the two SNRs, new evidence in support of the existence of physical interaction between the SN shocks and the adjoining molecular clouds. In the case of G349.7+0.2, the new observations revealed for the first time the internal structure of the shocked cloud, as well as the kinematical consequences of the impact of the SNR shock on the molecular cloud. From these observations we were able to constrain the conditions of the pre-shocked gas. The molecular cloud associated with G349.7+0.2, centered near vLSR= +16.2 km s-1, has a linear size of about 7 pc, a mass of ˜ 104 M⊙ and a volume density of ˜ 103 cm-3. The high line ratios derived are indicative of the existence of shocks in the cloud. From the asymmetries observed in the line shapes we propose that the SN shock cloud is running into the denser part of the cloud and has probably begun to disrupt it, pushing the eastern component clumps away from us, and the western fragments toward us. After comparing our estimates of the column density of the intervening gas with similar calculations based on ASCA X-rays spectral fitting we conclude that the best way to make these results compatible is by assuming that the associated cloud is placed behind G349.7+0.2 along the line of sight, and the SNR/molecular cloud encounter is taking place on the far side of the SNR. This model also provides a natural explanation for the lack of strong X-ray absorption in the central region of G349.7+0.2. Evaporation of part of the associated cloud must be responsible for the central X-ray emission. The comparison with IRAS infrared data provides additional support for the hypothesis of SNR/cloud physical interaction. From the study of the molecular gas in the neighborhood of the five OH (1720 MHz) masers detected in G349.7+0.2 we find that in three cases the maser peak velocity coincides with the local CO peak velocity, while in the remaining two cases the maser peak velocity agrees with a secondary, blended CO component. We conclude that the masers are excited at the sites where a non-dissociative C-type shock, locally transverse to the line of sight (or forming a large angle with it), hits a denser molecular clump. For the SNR G18.8+0.3, the new higher resolution observations have revealed excellent morphological agreement between one of the cloud components and the SNR shock front towards the eastern limb. The associated molecular mass is estimated to be ˜ 4.4× 104 M⊙ and the cloud volume density ˜1200 cm-3. The analysis of the line ratios in this case revealed a maximum of R2-1/1-0 = 1.25 at a position that exactly matches an indentation in the radio continuum emission in the remnant's shell, providing additional evidence of SNR/molecular cloud interaction.},

abstract = {Properties of self-similar solutions with varying power law exponents describing the interaction of an expanding supernova with the circumstellar medium created by presupernova mass loss are examined. The outflowing material comprises an inner shell of shocked ejecta and an outer shell of shocked ambient gas. Similarity variables are developed for the inner region and boundary conditions are defined for numerical solution. The pressure is assumed to be continuous at the contact discontinuity between the two regions and self-similar solutions yield the thicknesses of the two shells. Applications are made to the cases of Type I and II supernovae, showing that thin shells form initially which are over 300 times the ambient density, but optical emissions occur only when lumps of material are present in the shocked gas before the shock arrives. The self-similar solutions are found to be accurate if the expanding matter has a power-law distribution.},

This map is used with other images at 408, 1420, 2695 and 4800 MHz to investigate the total spectral index of the SNR and the variation of spectral index across it. The integrated spectral index is $\alpha$=0.54 +/-0.02 (where Snu_{prop.to}$\nu$^-$\alpha$^). Maps of the spectral-index variation across the source are derived using a method which calculates a differential spectral index. This method is independent of offset errors and large-scale background variations. Systematic spectral-index variations of ~+/-0.15 are found, consistently in the many independent pairs of data sets. Regions of higher spectral index (steeper spectra) appear around the periphery of the remnant and in its central area. Regions of lower spectral index (flatter spectra) are also found within the remnant. The latter may result from a change in the nature of the non-thermal emission or may represent "contamination" from underlying patches of thermal emission. There is no clear correlation of spectral index with intensity across the SNR. Theoretical reasons for spectral-index variations have been explored but no clear interpretation of the apparent spectral steepening near the shock front has been found nor has an explanation of the steep-spectrum central region.},

abstract = {Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) have been established as the most populous class of TeV gamma-ray emitters. Since launch, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)identified five high-energy (100MeV <E< 100 GeV) gamma-ray sources as PWNe, and detected a large number of PWNe candidates, all powered by young and energetic pulsars. The wealth of multi-wavelength data available and the new results provided by Fermi-LAT give us an opportunity to find new PWNe and to explore the radiative processes taking place in known ones. The TeV gamma-ray unidentifiedsources (UNIDs) are the best candidates for finding new PWNe. Using 45 months of Fermi-LAT data for energies above 10 GeV, an analysis was performed near the position of 58TeV PWNe and UNIDs within 5deg of the Galactic Plane to establish new constraints on PWNe properties and find new clues on the nature of UNIDs. Of the 58 sources, 30 were detected, and this work provides their gamma-rayfluxes for energies above 10 GeV. The spectral energy distributions (SED) andupper limits, in the multi-wavelength context, also provide new information on the source nature and can help distinguish between emission scenarios, i.e. between classification as a pulsar candidate or as a PWN candidate. Six new GeV PWNe candidates are described in detail and compared with existing models. A population study of GeV PWNe candidates as a function of the pulsar/PWN system characteristics is presented.},

The purpose of this note is to clarify the most commonly encountered difficulties in parameter error determination. These difficulties may arise in connection with any fitting program, but will be discussed here with the terminology of the program MINUIT for the convenience of MINUIT users. The most common causes of misinterpretation may be grouped into three categories: 1. Proper normalization of the user-supplied chi-square or likelihood function, and appropriate ERROR DEF. 2. Non-linearities in the problem formulation, leading to different errors being calculated by different techniques, such as MIGRAD, HESSE and MINOS. 3. Multiparameter error definition and interpretation. All these topic are discussed in some detail by Eadie et al., which may be consulted for further details.},

abstract = {A considerable fraction of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) characterize flat spectral indices ($\alpha<0.5$). There are several explanations of the flat radio spectra of SNRs in the present literature. The most of models involve a significant contribution of the second-order Fermi mechanism but some of them also discuss high compressions (>4), contribution of secondary electrons left over from the decay of charged pions, as well as the possibility of thermal contamination. In the case of expansion in high density environment, intrinsic thermal bremsstrahlung could theoretically shape the radio spectrum of an SNR and also account for observable curved -- "concave up" radio spectra of some Galactic SNRs. This model could also shed a light on the question of flat spectral indices determined in some Galactic SNRs. On the other hand, present knowledge of the radio continuum spectra (integrated flux densities at different frequencies) of SNRs prevent definite conclusions about the significance of proposed models so the question on flat spectral indices still remains open. New observations, especially at high radio continuum frequencies, are expected to solve these questions in the near future. Finally, as there is a significant connection between the majority of Galactic SNRs with flat integrated radio spectrum and their detection in $\gamma$-rays as well as detection of radiative recombination continua in their X-ray spectra, the analysis of high energy properties of these SNRs is very important.},

abstract = {Context: Observations of polarized emission are a significant source of information on the magnetic field that pervades the Interstellar Medium of the Galaxy. Despite the acknowledged importance of the magnetic field in interstellar processes, our knowledge of field configurations on all scales is seriously limited. Aims: This paper describes an extensive survey of polarized Galactic emission at 1.4 GHz that provides data with arcminute resolution and complete coverage of all structures from the broadest angular scales to the resolution limit, giving information on the magneto-ionic medium over a wide range of interstellar environments. Methods: Data from the DRAO Synthesis Telescope, the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope, and the DRAO 26-m Telescope have been combined. Angular resolution is ~1' and the survey extends from l = 66 deg to l = 175 deg over a range -3 deg < b < 5 deg along the northern Galactic plane, with a high-latitude extension from l = 101 deg to l = 116 deg up to b = 17.5 deg. This is the first extensive polarization survey to present aperture-synthesis data combined with data from single antennas, and the techniques developed to achieve this combination are described. Results: The appearance of the extended polarized emission at 1.4 GHz is dominated by Faraday rotation along the propagation path, and the diffuse polarized sky bears little resemblance to the total-intensity sky. There is extensive depolarization, arising from vector averaging on long lines of sight, from HII regions, and from diffuse ionized gas seen in H-alpha images. Preliminary interpretation is presented of selected polarization features on scales from parsecs (the planetary nebula Sh 2-216) to hundreds of parsecs (a supperbubble GSH 166-01-17) to kiloparsecs (polarized emission in the direction of Cygnus X).},

In particular, the shapes of the particle distribution functions and the shape of the seed photon spectrum used by the inverse Compton model are defined in separate modules and may be customized for specific applications. We assess the accuracy of these models by using a recurrence relation and by comparing them with analytic results and with previous numerical work by other authors.},

abstract = {Context: Cosmic rays are thought to be accelerated at supernova remnant (SNR) shocks, but conclusive evidence is lacking. Aims: New data from ground-based gamma-ray telescopes and the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope are used to test this hypothesis. A simple model for gamma-ray production efficiency is compared with measured gamma-ray luminosities of SNRs, and the GeV to TeV fluxes ratios of SNRs are examined for correlations with SNR ages. Methods: The supernova explosion is modeled as an expanding spherical shell of material that sweeps up matter from the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). The accumulated kinetic energy of the shell, which provides the energy available for nonthermal particle acceleration, changes when matter is swept up from the ISM and the SNR shell decelerates. A fraction of this energy is assumed to be converted into the energy of cosmic-ray electrons or protons. Three different particle radiation processes---nuclear pion-production interactions, nonthermal electron bremsstrahlung, and Compton scattering---are considered. Results: The efficiencies for gamma-ray production by these three processes are compared with gamma-ray luminosities of SNRs. Our results suggest that SNRs become less gamma-ray luminous at >~ 10^4 yr, and are consistent with the hypothesis that supernova remnants accelerate cosmic rays with an efficiency of ~10% for the dissipation of kinetic energy into nonthermal cosmic rays. Weak evidence for an increasing GeV to TeV flux ratio with SNR age is found.},

abstract = {We study the escape of cosmic-ray protons accelerated at a supernova remnant (SNR). We are interested in their propagation in the interstellar medium (ISM) after they leave the shock neighborhood where they are accelerated, but when they are still near the SNR with their energy density higher than that in the average ISM. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we found that the cosmic rays with energies of lsim TeV excite Alfv{\'e}n waves around the SNR on a scale of the SNR itself if the ISM is highly ionized. Thus, even if the cosmic rays can leave the shock, scattering by the waves prevents them from moving further away from the SNR. The cosmic rays form a slowly expanding cosmic-ray bubble, and they spend a long time around the SNR. This means that the cosmic rays cannot actually escape from the SNR until a fairly late stage of the SNR evolution. This is consistent with some results of Fermi and H.E.S.S. observations.},

We made a comparative study of CO, HI and X-rays in order to better understand the relationship between the X-rays, and molecular and atomic gas. The results indicate that the X-rays are enhanced around the CO and HI clumps on a pc scale but decrease inside the clumps on a 0.1 pc scale. Magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of the shock interaction with molecular and atomic gas indicate that the interaction between the shock waves and the clumps excite turbulence which amplifies the magnetic field around the clumps. We suggest that the amplified magnetic field around the CO and HI clumps enhances the synchrotron X-rays and possibly the acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons.},

abstract = {Supernovae (SNe) are generally classified into Type I and Type II. Most SNe (~ 80%), including all the subtypes of Type II, and Type Ib/c, arise from the core-collapse of massive stars. During their lifetime, mass-loss from these stars considerably modifies the medium around the stars. When the stars explode as SNe, the resulting shock wave will expand in this wind-modified medium. In contrast, Type Ia SNe will expand in a relatively uniform medium, but the dynamics are different from those of core-collapse SNe. For young supernova remnants, the properties of the ejecta as well as the surrounding medium are important in determining the subsequent evolution of the SN shock wave, and the dynamics and kinematics of the remnant. This will influence the acceleration of particles at the SN shocks, and consequently affect the gamma-ray emission from the remnant. Herein we discuss the expected properties, especially the density structure, of the medium around various types and sub-types of SNe, as suggested by current stellar evolution models. Using analytic and semi-analytic models and numerical simulations, we investigate how these affect the kinematics of the SN shock waves, assess the impact this would have on the production of cosmic rays, and show how it influences the time-evolution of the hadronic gamma-ray emission from the remnant. In the case of SNRs evolving in a wind medium, the emission should reach a maximum early on, and thereafter decrease with time. For SNe in a constant density medium, the emission would be expected to increase with time upto the advent of the Sedov stage.},

abstract = {Context. After the release of the gamma-ray source catalog produced by the Fermi satellite during its first two years of operation, a significant fraction of sources still remain unassociated at lower energies. In addition to well-known high-energy emitters (pulsars, blazars, supernova remnants, etc.) theoretical expectations predict new classes of gamma-ray sources. In particular, gamma-ray emission could be associated with some of the early phases of stellar evolution, but this interesting possibility is still poorly understood. Aims. The aim of this paper is to assess the possibility of the Fermi gamma-ray source 2FGL J0607.5-0618c being associated with the massive star forming region Monoceros R2. Methods. A multi-wavelength analysis of the Monoceros R2 region is carried out using archival data at radio, infrared, X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths. The resulting observational properties are used to estimate the physical parameters needed to test the different physical scenarios. Results. We confirm the 2FGL J0607.5-0618c detection with improved confidence over the Fermi two-year catalog. We find that a combined effect of the multiple young stellar objects in Monoceros R2 is a viable picture for the nature of the source.},

abstract = {We have investigated the field around the radio-quiet $\gamma$-ray pulsar, PSR J2021+4026, with a ~140 ks XMM-Newton observation and a ~56 ks archival Chandra data. Through analyzing the pulsed spectrum, we show that the X-ray pulsation is purely thermal in nature which suggests the pulsation is originated from a hot polar cap with $T\sim3\times10^{6}$ K on the surface of a rotating neutron star. On the other hand, the power-law component that dominates the pulsar emission in the hard band is originated from off-pulse phases, which possibly comes from a pulsar wind nebula. In re-analyzing the Chandra data, we have confirmed the presence of bow-shock nebula which extends from the pulsar to west by ~10 arcsec. The orientation of this nebular feature suggests that the pulsar is probably moving eastward which is consistent with the speculated proper motion by extrapolating from the nominal geometrical center of the supernova remnant (SNR) G78.2+2.1 to the current pulsar position. For G78.2+2.1, our deep XMM-Newton observation also enables a study of the central region and part of the southeastern region with superior photon statistics. The column absorption derived for the SNR is comparable with that for PSR J2021+4026, which supports their association. The remnant emission in both examined regions are in an non-equilibrium ionization state. Also, the elapsed time of both regions after shock-heating is apparently shorter than the Sedov age of G78.2+2.1. This might suggest the reverse shock has reached the center not long ago. Apart from PSR J2021+4026 and G78.2+2.1, we have also serendipitously detected an X-ray flash-like event XMM J202154.7+402855 from this XMM-Newton observation.},

The 30Dor-10 cloud north of R136 was mapped in 12CO 2-1, 13CO 2-1, C18O 2-1, 1.3mm continuum, the H30alpha recombination line, and two H2CO 3-2 transitions. Most 12CO emission is associated with small filaments and clumps (<1pc, ~1000 Msun at the current resolution). Some clumps are associated with protostars, including "pillars of creation" photoablated by intense radiation from R136. Emission from molecular clouds is often analyzed by decomposition into approximately beam-sized clumps. Such clumps in 30 Doradus follow similar trends in size, linewidth, and surface density to Milky Way clumps. The 30 Doradus clumps have somewhat larger linewidths for a given size than predicted by Larson's scaling relation, consistent with pressure confinement. They extend to higher surface density at a given size and linewidth compared to clouds studied at 10pc resolution. These trends are also true of clumps in Galactic infrared-dark clouds; higher resolution observations of both environments are required. Consistency of clump masses calculated from dust continuum, CO, and the virial theorem reveals that the CO abundance in 30 Doradus clumps is not significantly different from the LMC mean, but the dust abundance may be reduced by ~2. There are no strong trends in clump properties with distance from R136; dense clumps are not strongly affected by the external radiation field, but there is a modest trend towards lower dense clump filling fraction deeper in the cloud.},

abstract = {Thanks to the success of current gamma-ray telescopes (Fermi, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS), and in view of the prospects of planned observatories such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) or the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), gamma-ray astronomy is becoming an integral part of modern astrophysical research. Analysis today relies on a large diversity of tools and software frameworks that were specifically and independently developed for each instrument. With the aim of unifying the analysis of gamma-ray data, we are currently developing GammaLib (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gammalib), a C++ library interfaced to Python that provides a framework for an instrument independent analysis of gamma-ray data. On top of GammaLib we have created ctools (http://cta.irap.omp.eu/ctools), a set of analysis executables that is being developed as one of the prototypes for the CTA high-level science analysis framework, but which is equally suited for the analysis of gamma-ray data from the existing Fermi-LAT telescope and current Cherenkov telescope arrays. In particular, ctools and GammaLib provide the novel opportunity of a simultaneous multi-instrument analysis. We present the status of the software development, and illustrate its capabilities with a spectral analysis of the Crab nebula emission over seven decades in energy (1 MeV to 10 TeV) using multi-instrument (COMPTEL, Fermi-LAT, H.E.S.S.) gamma-ray observations as well as a simulation of a CTA observation of the supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946.},

abstract = {Astronomy and astrophysics are witnessing dramatic increases in data volume as detectors, telescopes and computers become ever more powerful. During the last decade, sky surveys across the electromagnetic spectrum have collected hundreds of terabytes of astronomical data for hundreds of millions of sources. Over the next decade, the data volume will enter the petabyte domain, and provide accurate measurements for billions of sources. Astronomy and physics students are not traditionally trained to handle such voluminous and complex data sets. In this paper we describe astroML; an initiative, based on Python and scikit-learn, to develop a compendium of machine learning tools designed to address the statistical needs of the next generation of students and astronomical surveys. We introduce astroML and present a number of example applications that are enabled by this package.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray and microwave observations of the Cygnus region reveal an intense signal of 1.809 Me line emission, attributed to radioactive decay of 26, that is closely correlated with 53 GHz free-free emission, originating from the ionised interstellar medium. We modelled both emissions using a multi-wavelength evolutionary synthesis code for massive star associations that we applied to the known massive star populations in Cygnus. For all OB associations and young open clusters in the field, we determined the population age, distance, and richness as well as the uncertainties in all these quantities from published photometric and spectroscopic data. We propagate the population uncertainties in model uncertainties by means of a Bayesian method. The young globular cluster Cyg OB2 turns out to be the dominant 26 nucleosynthesis and ionisation source in Cygnus. Our model reproduces the ionising luminosity of the Cygnus region very well, yet it underestimates 26 production by about a factor of 2. We attribute this underestimation to shortcomings of current nucleosynthesis models, and suggest the inclusion of stellar rotation as possible mechanism to enhance 26 production. We also modelled 60Fe nucleosynthesis in the Cygnus region, yet the small number of recent supernova events suggests only little 60Fe production. Consequently, a detection of the 1.137 Me and 1.332 Me decay lines of 60Fe from Cygnus by the upcoming INTEGRAL observatory is not expected.

abstract = {The role pulsar wind nebulae play in producing our locally observed cosmic ray spectrum remains murky, yet intriguing. Pulsar wind nebulae are born and evolve in conjunction with SNRs, which are favored sites of Galactic cosmic ray acceleration. As a result they frequently complicate interpretation of the gamma-ray emission seen from SNRs. However, pulsar wind nebulae may also contribute directly to the local cosmic ray spectrum, particularly the leptonic component. This paper reviews the current thinking on pulsar wind nebulae and their connection to cosmic ray production from an observational perspective. It also considers how both future technologies and new ways of analyzing existing data can help us to better address the relevant theoretical questions. A number of key points will be illustrated with recent results from the VHE (E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray observatory VERITAS.},

abstract = {The radio spectra of many shell-type supernova remnants show deviations from those expected on theoretical grounds. In this paper we determine the effect of stochastic reacceleration on the spectra of electrons in the GeV band and at lower energies, and we investigate whether or not reacceleration can explain the observed variation of radio spectral indices. We explicitely calculate the momentum diffusion coefficient for 3 types of turbulence expected downstream of the forward shock: fast-mode waves, small-scale non-resonant modes, and large-scale modes arising from turbulent dynamo activity. Noting that low-energy particles are efficiently coupled to the quasi-thermal plasma, a simplified cosmic-ray transport equation can be formulated and is numerically solved. Only fast-mode waves can provide momentum diffusion fast enough to significantly modify the spectra of particles. Using a synchrotron emissivity that accurately reflects a highly turbulent magnetic field, we calculate the radio spectral index and find that soft spectra with index $\alpha\lesssim -0.6$ can be maintained over more than 2 decades in radio frequency, even if the electrons experience reacceleration for only one acceleration time. A spectral hardening is possible but considerably more frequency-dependent. The spectral modification imposed by stochastic reacceleration downstream of the forward shock depends only weakly on the initial spectrum provided by, e.g., diffusive shock acceleration at the shock itself.},

abstract = {We present results of CO J = 2-1 line mapping of molecular clouds in the vicinity of the supernova remnants (SNRs) W44 and IC 443. Large areas spanning ~1.5d × 2$\,^{\circ}$ were observed with the 9' beam of the University of Tokyo-Nobeyama Radio Observatory 60 cm Survey Telescope. We identified six giant molecular clouds (GMCs) with masses (0.3-3) × 105 M⊙ around W44. Three show evidence of interaction with the SNR. In particular, one exhibits a line wing emission and an abrupt velocity shift at the position at which the cloud overlaps with the SNR. The CO J = 2-1/J = 1-0 line intensity ratio significantly exceeds unity (1.3) in the wing. In IC 443, a high-velocity line wing emission was detected in CO J = 2-1 with our 9' beam. The CO J = 2-1/J = 1-0 ratio is extremely high (>3) in the wing, which suggests that the emission comes from spatially extended optically thin ($\tau$ ~ 0.1), dense [n(H2) ~ 105 cm-3], and warm (~80 K) gas. W44 is established as a good example of an SNR interacting with GMCs, while IC 443 is in interaction with a low-mass dark cloud. The mass and kinetic energy of the shocked gas are, respectively, 1 × 103 M⊙ and 4 × 1048 ergs in W44, and 70 M⊙ and 6 × 1047 ergs in IC 443. A very high CO J = 2-1/J = 1-0 ratio in the line wings of a GMC may be a useful marker of interaction with an SNR. Such a marker would be extremely valuable for determining GMC-SNR associations in the inner Galaxy where numerous GMCs often lie along the line of sight. Such associations often provide the best means of determining SNR distances.},

abstract = {Plerions represent ideal laboratories for the search for neutron stars, the study of their relativistic winds, and their interaction with their surrounding supernova ejecta and/or the interstellar medium. As well, they are widely believed to represent efficient engines for particle acceleration up to the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum (at about 1E15 eV). Multi-wavelength observations from the radio to the highest TeV energies, combined with modelling, have opened a new window to study these objects, and particularly shed light on their intrinsic properties, diversity, and evolution. High-resolution X-ray observations are further revealing the structure and sites for shock acceleration. The missing shells in the majority of these objects remain puzzling, and the presence of plerions around highly magnetized neutron stars is still questionable. I review the current status and statistics of observations of plerionic supernova remnants (SNRs), highlighting combined radio and X-ray observations of a growing class of atypical, non Crab-like, plerionic SNRs in our Galaxy. I will also briefly describe the latest developments to our high-energy SNRs catalogue recently released to the community, and finally highlight the key questions to be addressed in this field with future high-energy missions, including Astro-H in the very near future.},

abstract = {Context. Whether the Cygnus X complex consists of one physically connected region of star formation or of multiple independent regions projected close together on the sky has been debated for decades. The main reason for this puzzling scenario is the lack of trustworthy distance measurements. Aims: We aim to understand the structure and dynamics of the star-forming regions toward Cygnus X by accurate distance and proper motion measurements. Methods: To measure trigonometric parallaxes, we observed 6.7 GHz methanol and 22 GHz water masers with the European VLBI Network and the Very Long Baseline Array. Results: We measured the trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of five massive star-forming regions toward the Cygnus X complex and report the following distances within a 10% accuracy: 1.30+0.07-0.07 kpc for W75N, 1.46+0.09-0.08 kpc for DR20, 1.50+0.08-0.07 kpc for DR21, 1.36+0.12-0.11 kpc for IRAS 20290+4052, and 3.33+0.11-0.11 kpc for AFGL 2591. While the distances of W 75N, DR 20, DR 21, and IRAS 20290+4052 are consistent with a single distance of 1.40 $\pm$ 0.08 kpc for the Cygnus X complex, AFGL 2591 is located at a much greater distance than previously assumed. The space velocities of the four star-forming regions in the Cygnus X complex do not suggest an expanding Str{\"o}mgren sphere.},

abstract = {Diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission is the most prominent observable signature of celestial cosmic-ray interactions at high energies. While already being investigated at GeV energies over several decades, assessments of diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission at TeV energies remain sparse. After completion of the systematic survey of the inner Galaxy, the H.E.S.S. experiment is in a prime position to observe large-scale diffuse emission at TeV energies. Data of the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey are investigated in regions off known $\gamma$-ray sources. Corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux measurements were made over an extensive grid of celestial locations. Longitudinal and latitudinal profiles of the observed $\gamma$-ray fluxes show characteristic excess emission not attributable to known $\gamma$-ray sources. For the first time large-scale $\gamma$-ray emission along the Galactic Plane using imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes has been observed. While the background subtraction technique limits the ability to recover modest variation on the scale of the H.E.S.S. field of view or larger, which is characteristic of the inverse Compton scatter-induced Galactic diffuse emission, contributions of neutral pion decay as well as emission from unresolved $\gamma$-ray sources can be recovered in the observed signal to a large fraction. Calculations show that the minimum $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$-decay represents a significant contribution to the total signal. This detection is interpreted as a mix of diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission and unresolved sources.},

Multi-wavelength observations on these Gamma-ray sources have proven to be robust in shedding light on their nature.

We in the paper summarize a list of known Galactic {\gamma}-ray Supernova Remnants (SNRs) with or without radio emissions so far, which includes some SNRs deserving top priority for future multi-wavelength observations.},

abstract = {One century ago Viktor Hess carried out several balloon flights that led him to conclude that the penetrating radiation responsible for the discharge of electroscopes was of extraterrestrial origin. One century from the discovery of this phenomenon seems to be a good time to stop and think about what we have understood about Cosmic Rays. The aim of this review is to illustrate the ideas that have been and are being explored in order to account for the observable quantities related to cosmic rays and to summarize the numerous new pieces of observation that are becoming available. In fact, despite the possible impression that development in this field is somewhat slow, the rate of new discoveries in the last decade or so has been impressive, and mainly driven by beautiful pieces of observation. At the same time scientists in this field have been able to propose new, fascinating ways to investigate particle acceleration inside the sources, making use of multifrequency observations that range from the radio, to the optical, to X-rays and gamma rays. These ideas can now be confronted with data. I will mostly focus on supernova remnants as the most plausible sources of Galactic cosmic rays, and I will review the main aspects of the modern theory of diffusive particle acceleration at supernova remnant shocks, with special attention for the dynamical reaction of accelerated particles on the shock and the phenomenon of magnetic field amplification at the shock. Cosmic-ray escape from the sources is discussed as a necessary step to determine the spectrum of cosmic rays at the Earth. The discussion of these theoretical ideas will always proceed parallel to an account of the data being collected especially in X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy. In the end of this review I will also discuss the phenomenon of cosmic-ray acceleration at shocks propagating in partially ionized media and the implications of this phenomenon in terms of width of the Balmer line emission. This field of research has recently experienced a remarkable growth, in that H$\alpha$ lines have been found to bear information on the cosmic-ray acceleration efficiency of supernova shocks.},

abstract = {We report the detection of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission from the supernova remnant (SNR) Puppis A with the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. Puppis A is among the faintest SNRs yet detected at GeV energies, with a luminosity of only 2.7 × 1034 (D/2.2 kpc)2 erg s-1 between 1 and 100 GeV. The $\gamma$-ray emission from the remnant is spatially extended, with a morphology matching that of the radio and X-ray emission, and is well described by a simple power law with an index of 2.1. We attempt to model the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED), from radio to $\gamma$-rays, using standard nonthermal emission mechanisms. To constrain the relativistic electron population we use 7 years of Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data to extend the radio spectrum up to 93 GHz. Both leptonic- and hadronic-dominated models can reproduce the nonthermal SED, requiring a total content of cosmic-ray electrons and protons accelerated in Puppis A of at least W CR ≈ (1-5) × 1049 erg.},

abstract = {Context. Cygnus X is one of the most complex areas in the sky, rich in massive stars; Cyg OB2 (2600 stars, 120 O stars) and other OB associations lie within its boundaries. This complicates interpretation, but also creates the opportunity to investigate accretion into molecular clouds and many subsequent stages of star formation, all within one small field of view. Understanding large complexes like Cygnus X is the key to understanding the dominant role that massive star complexes play in galaxies across the Universe. Aims: The main goal of this study is to establish feasibility of a high-resolution CO survey of the entire Cygnus X region by observing part of it as a pathfinder, and to evaluate the survey as a tool for investigating the star-formation process. We can investigate the mass accretion history of outflows, study interaction between star-forming regions and their cold environment, and examine triggered star formation around massive stars. Methods: A 2$\,^{\circ}$ × 4$\,^{\circ}$ area of the Cygnus X region has been mapped in the 12CO(3-2) line at an angular resolution of 15'' and a velocity resolution of ~0.4 km s-1 using HARP-B and ACSIS on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. The star formation process is heavily connected to the life-cycle of the molecular material in the interstellar medium. The high critical density of the 12CO(3-2) transition reveals clouds in key stages of molecule formation, and shows processes that turn a molecular cloud into a star. Results: We observed ~15% of Cygnus X, and demonstrated that a full survey would be feasible and rewarding. We detected three distinct layers of 12CO(3-2) emission, related to the Cygnus Rift (500-800 pc), to W75N (1-1.8 kpc), and to DR 21 (1.5-2.5 kpc). Within the Cygnus Rift, H i self-absorption features are tightly correlated with faint diffuse CO emission, while HISA features in the DR 21 layer are mostly unrelated to any CO emission. 47 molecular outflows were detected in the pathfinder, 27 of them previously unknown. Sequentially triggered star formation is a widespread phenomenon.},

abstract = {We study the mass spectrum of sub-structures in the Perseus Molecular Cloud Complex traced by 13CO (1-0), finding that $dN/dM\propto M^{-2.4}$ for the standard Clumpfind parameters. This result does not agree with the classical $dN/dM\propto M^{-1.6}$. To understand this discrepancy we study the robustness of the mass spectrum derived using the Clumpfind algorithm. Both 2D and 3D Clumpfind versions are tested, using 850 $\mu$m dust emission and 13CO spectral-line observations of Perseus, respectively. The effect of varying threshold is not important, but varying stepsize produces a different effect for 2D and 3D cases. In the 2D case, where emission is relatively isolated (associated with only the densest peaks in the cloud), the mass spectrum variability is negligible compared to the mass function fit uncertainties. In the 3D case, however, where the 13CO emission traces the bulk of the molecular cloud, the number of clumps and the derived mass spectrum are highly correlated with the stepsize used. The distinction between "2D" and "3D" here is more importantly also a distinction between "sparse" and "crowded" emission. In any "crowded" case, Clumpfind should not be used blindly to derive mass functions. Clumpfind's output in the "crowded" case can still offer a statistical description of emission useful in inter-comparisons, but the clump-list should not be treated as a robust region decomposition suitable to generate a physically-meaningful mass function. We conclude that the 13CO mass spectrum depends on the observations resolution, due to the hierarchical structure of MC.

abstract = {(abridged) We review methods for measuring the sizes, line widths, and luminosities of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in molecular-line data cubes with low resolution and sensitivity. We find that moment methods are robust and sensitive -- making full use of both position and intensity information -- and we recommend a standard method to measure the position angle, major and minor axis sizes, line width, and luminosity using moment methods. Without corrections for the effects of beam convolution and sensitivity to GMC properties, the resulting properties may be severely biased. This is particularly true for extragalactic observations, where resolution and sensitivity effects often bias measured values by 40% or more. We correct for finite spatial and spectral resolutions with a simple deconvolution and we correct for sensitivity biases by extrapolating properties of a GMC to those we would expect to measure with perfect sensitivity. The resulting method recovers the properties of a GMC to within 10% over a large range of resolutions and sensitivities, provided the clouds are marginally resolved with a peak signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10. We note that interferometers systematically underestimate cloud properties, particularly the flux from a cloud. The degree of bias depends on the sensitivity of the observations and the (u,v) coverage of the observations. In the Appendix to the paper we present a conservative, new decomposition algorithm for identifying GMCs in molecular-line observations. This algorithm treats the data in physical rather than observational units, does not produce spurious clouds in the presence of noise, and is sensitive to a range of morphologies. As a result, the output of this decomposition should be directly comparable among disparate data sets.

abstract = {Puppis A is an interesting ~4 kyr-old supernova remnant (SNR) that shows strong evidence of interaction between the forward shock and a molecular cloud. It has been studied in detail from radio frequencies to high-energy (HE, 0.1-100 GeV) gamma-rays. An analysis of the Fermi-LAT data has shown an extended HE gamma-ray emission with a 0.2-100 GeV spectrum exhibiting no significant deviation from a power law, unlike most of the GeV-emitting SNRs known to be interacting with molecular clouds. This makes it a promising target for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) to probe the gamma-ray emission above 100 GeV. Very-high-energy (VHE, E >= 0.1 TeV) gamma-ray emission from Puppis A is for the first time searched for with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). The analysis of the H.E.S.S. data does not reveal any significant emission towards Puppis A. The derived upper limits on the differential photon flux imply that its broadband gamma-ray spectrum must exhibit a spectral break or cutoff. By combining Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. measurements, the 99% confidence level upper limits on such a cutoff are found to be 450 and 280 GeV, assuming a power law with a simple exponential and a sub-exponential cutoff, respectively. It is concluded that none of the standard limitations (age, size, radiative losses) on the particle acceleration mechanism, assumed to be still on-going at present, can explain the lack of VHE signal. The scenario in which particle acceleration has ceased some time ago is considered as an alternative explanation. The HE/VHE spectrum of Puppis A could then exhibit a break of non-radiative origin, (as observed in several other interacting SNRs, albeit at somewhat higher energies) owing to the interaction with dense and neutral material in particular towards the northeastern region.},

abstract = {Cosmic rays are an essential ingredient in the evolution of the interstellar medium, as they dominate the ionisation of the dense molecular gas, where stars and planets form. However, since they are efficiently scattered by the galactic magnetic fields, many questions remain open, such as where exactly they are accelerated, what is their original energy spectrum, and how they propagate into molecular clouds. In this work we present new observations and discuss in detail a method that allows us to measure the cosmic ray ionisation rate towards the molecular clouds close to the W28 supernova remnant. To perform these measurements, we use CO, HCO+, and DCO+ millimetre line observations and compare them with the predictions of radiative transfer and chemical models away from thermodynamical equilibrium. The CO observations allow us to constrain the density, temperature, and column density towards each observed position, while the DCO+/HCO+ abundance ratios provide us with constraints on the electron fraction and, consequently, on the cosmic ray ionisation rate. Towards positions located close to the supernova remnant, we find cosmic ray ionisation rates much larger (≳100) than those in standard galactic clouds. Conversely, towards one position situated at a larger distance, we derive a standard cosmic ray ionisation rate. Overall, these observations support the hypothesis that the $\gamma$ rays observed in the region have a hadronic origin. In addition, based on CR diffusion estimates, we find that the ionisation of the gas is likely due to 0.1-1 GeV cosmic rays. Finally, these observations are also in agreement with the global picture of cosmic ray diffusion, in which the low-energy tail of the cosmic ray population diffuses at smaller distances than the high-energy counterpart.},

abstract = {Recently, the HESS array has reported the detection of $\gamma$-ray emission above a few hundred GeV from eight new sources located close to the Galactic plane. The source HESS J1834-087 is spatially coincident with the supernova remnant G23.3-0.3 (W41). Here we present MAGIC observations of this source, resulting in the detection of a differential $\gamma$-ray flux consistent with a power law, described as dN$\gamma$/(dAdtdE)=(3.7+/-0.6)×10-12(E/TeV)-2.5+/-0.2 cm-2 s-1 TeV-1. We confirm the extended character of this flux. We briefly discuss the observational technique used and the procedure implemented for the data analysis, and we put this detection in the perspective of the molecular environment found in the region of W41. We present 13CO and 12CO emission maps showing the existence of a massive molecular cloud in spatial superposition with the MAGIC detection.},

The Great Annihilator is known to be near a small, bright molecular cloud in a region largely devoid of emission in 12CO surveys of the Galactic center. This region is of interest because it is interior to the dust lanes which may be the shock zones where atomic gas from the HI nuclear disk is converted into molecular gas. We find that the region is populated with a large number of dense (n ~ 105 cm-3) regions of excited gas with small filling factors. The gas appears to have turbulent support and may be the result of sprays of material from collisions in the shock zone. We estimate that ~(1-3) × 105 M sun of shocked gas resides in our r ~ 3', $\Delta$v LSR = 100 km s-1 field. If this gas has recently shocked and is interior to the inner Lindblad resonance of the dominant bar, it is in transit to the x 2 disk, suggesting that a significant amount of mass may be transported to the disk by a low filling factor population of molecular clouds with low surface brightness in larger surveys.},

abstract = {We descibe an automatic, objective routine for analyzing the clumpy structure in a spectral line position-position-velocity data cube. The algorithm works by first contouring the data at a multiple of the rms noise of the observations, then searches for peaks of emission which locate the clumps, and then follows them down to lower intensities. No a proiri clump profile is assumed. By creating simulated data, we test the performance of the algorithm and show that a contour map most accurately depicts internal structure at a contouring interval equal to twice the rms noise of the map. Blending of clump emission leads to small errors in mass and size determinations and in severe cases can result in a number of clumps being misidentified as a single unit, flattening the measured clump mass spectrum. The algorithm is applied to two real data sets as an example of its use. The Rosette molecular cloud is a 'typical' star-forming cloud, but in the Maddalena molecular cloud high-mass star formation is completely absent. Comparison of the two clump lists generated by the algorithm show that on a one-to-one basis the clumps in the star-forming cloud have higher peak temperatures, higher average densities, and are more gravitationally bound than in the non-star-forming cloud. Collective properties of the clumps, such as temperature-size-line-width-mass relations appear very similar, however. Contrary to the initial results reported in a previous paper (Williams {\&} Blitz 1993), we find that the current, more thoroughly tes ted analysis finds no significant difference in the clump mass spectrum of the two clouds.},

Here we systematically determine the gamma-ray emission from all known Galactic SNRs, disentangling them from the sea of Galactic cosmic rays. Using Fermi LAT data we have characterized the GeV emission in all regions containing SNRs, accounting for systematic uncertainties caused by source confusion, diffuse emission modeling, and instrumental response. More than a dozen remnants are identified through spatial extension or detection at TeV energies, with potential associations for >40 more. From this population study, two clear classes of gamma-ray-emitting SNRs emerge: young remnants and those interacting with a dense medium. This large statistical sample also reveals a possible correlation between GeV and radio flux. The growing number of identified SNRs will help to disentangle the effects of age and environment on the aggregate properties of SNRs at high energies.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the utility of dendrograms at representing the essential features of the hierarchical structure of the isosurfaces for molecular line data cubes. The dendrogram of a data cube is an abstraction of the changing topology of the isosurfaces as a function of contour level. The ability to track hierarchical structure over a range of scales makes this analysis philosophically different from local segmentation algorithms like CLUMPFIND. Points in the dendrogram structure correspond to specific volumes in data cubes defined by their bounding isosurfaces. We further refine the technique by measuring the properties associated with each isosurface in the analysis allowing for a multiscale calculation of molecular gas properties. Using COMPLETE 13CO (J=1-->0) data from the L1448 region in Perseus and mock observations of a simulated data cube, we identify regions that have a significant contribution by self-gravity to their energetics on a range of scales. We find evidence for self-gravitation on all spatial scales in L1448, although not in all regions. In the simulated observations, nearly all of the emission is found in objects that would be self-gravitating if gravity were included in the simulation. We reconstruct the size-line-width relationship within the data cube using the dendrogram-derived properties and find it follows the standard relation: $\sigma$v~R0.58. Finally, we show that constructing the dendrogram of CO (J=1-->0) emission from the Orion-Monoceros region allows for the identification of giant molecular clouds in a blended molecular line data set using only a physically motivated definition (self-gravitating clouds with masses >5×104 Msolar).},

abstract = {The area of most intense radio emission in the shell of the supernova remnant G78.2+2.1 has been observed in the 115-GHz line of (C-12)O. Previous H I observations of this region had revealed the presence of several dense cloudlets apparently accelerated by the SNR blast. No corresponding features are apparent in the CO observations. The absence of accelerated CO is interpreted as evidence that either the SNR shock velocity is so high that any pre-existing CO is chemically dissociated by the shock, or the pre-shock cloudlets were too diffuse to contain CO. The undisturbed CO in this region is found to be confined to four main clouds having typical angular sizes of 10-15 arcmin.},

abstract = {Observations of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from supernova remnants (SNR) established them as sources of accelerated particles up to energies of 100 TeV. The dominant process - leptonic or hadronic - responsible for the VHE emission is still not proven for most of the SNRs. Molecular clouds (MCs) in the vicinity of SNRs provide increased amount of target material for accelerated particles escaping the SNRs, thus making MCs potential gamma-ray sources. The predicted gamma-ray flux for MCs offset from the SNR shock depends on the applied diffusion model for VHE particles and the SNR and MC properties, which encounter large uncertainties. While the the average galactic diffusion coefficient is estimated, the spatially resolved propagation properties of VHE cosmic rays are unknown. gamma-ray emitting MCs provide a unique possibility to derive new information on the propagation of VHE particles through the ISM and on the acceleration of hadrons at SNRs. We present in this paper a strategy and first results of a systematic search for TeV gamma-ray emitting MCs in the vicinity of SNRs in the galactic plane region. Based on a theoretical model and current SNR and MC catalogues the detectable parameter space (e.g. diffusion coefficient, SNR age) for current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope systems (IACTs) is obtained. This allows to identify potential gamma-ray emitting regions.},

The current is inversely proportional to the maximum energy of cosmic rays, and is a strong function of the shock velocity. Depending on the evolution of the shock wave, which is drastically different for different circumstellar environments, the maximum energy of cosmic rays as required to generate enough current to trigger the non-resonant hybrid instability that confines the cosmic rays follows a different evolution and reaches different values. We find that the best candidates to accelerate cosmic rays to ~few PeV energies are young remnants in a dense environment, such as a red supergiant wind, as may be applicable to Cassiopeia A. We also find that for a typical background magnetic field strength of 5 microG the instability is quenched in about 1000 years, making SN1006 just at the border of candidates for cosmic ray acceleration to high energies.},

SNR shocks are expected to be sites of cosmic ray acceleration, and clouds of dense material can provide effective targets for production of gamma-rays from neutral pion-decay. The observations reveal unresolved sources in the direction of G337.0-0.1, and MSH 17-39, and an extended source coincident with W41. We model their broadband emission (radio to gamma-ray) using a simple one-zone model, and after considering scenarios in which the MeV-TeV sources originate from either neutral pion-decay or leptonic emission, we conclude that the gamma-rays are most likely produced through the hadronic channel.},

This structure lies between the Cygnus OB2 association and the gamma-Cygni SNR, which is bright in gamma rays above 10 GeV. The atmospheric Cherenkov observatory VERITAS also sees VHE (> 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission from the direction gamma-Cygni (VER J2019+407). We discuss the relationship of VER J2019+407 to both the gamma-Cygni SNR and the cocoon. Toy model simulations are used to evaluate prospects for detecting the cocoon at very high energies with VERITAS, as well as ways in which cocoon emission at these energies could impact measurements of the morphology and spectrum of VER J2019+407.},

This publication aims at determining a more accurate distance for 3C58 and re-evaluating the arguments for a larger age. I have re-visited the distance determination of 3C58 based on new HI data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey and our recent improvements in the knowledge of the rotation curve of the outer Milky Way Galaxy. I have also used newly determined distances to objects in the neighbourhood, which are based on direct measurements by trigonometric parallax. I have derived a new more reliable distance estimate of 2 kpc for 3C58. This makes the connection between the pulsar wind nebula and the historical event from A.D. 1181 once again much more viable.},

abstract = {Context: We investigate non-Zeeman circular polarization and linear polarization levels of up to 1% of $^{12}$CO spectral line emission detected in a shocked molecular clump around the supernova remnant (SNR) IC 443, with the goal of understanding the magnetic field structure in this source. Aims: We examine our polarization results to confirm that the circular polarization signal in CO lines is caused by a conversion of linear to circular polarization, consistent with anisotropic resonant scattering. In this process background linearly polarized CO emission interacts with similar foreground molecules aligned with the ambient magnetic field and scatters at a transition frequency. The difference in phase shift between the orthogonally polarized components of this scattered emission can cause a transformation of linear to circular polarization. Methods: We compared linear polarization maps from dust continuum, obtained with PolKa at APEX, and $^{12}$CO ($J=2\rightarrow1$) and ($J=1\rightarrow0$) from the IRAM 30-m telescope and found no consistency between the two sets of polarization maps. We then reinserted the measured circular polarization signal in the CO lines across the source to the corresponding linear polarization signal to test whether before this linear to circular polarization conversion the linear polarization vectors of the CO maps were aligned with those of the dust. Results: After the flux correction for the two transitions of the CO spectral lines, the new polarization vectors for both CO transitions aligned with the dust polarization vectors, establishing that the non-Zeeman CO circular polarization is due to a linear to circular polarization conversion.},

We observe a characteristic Zeeman profile in the Stokes V spectrum, which allows us to derive a magnetic field of 1.5 and 1.7 mG for G32.8-0.1 and G346.6-0.2, respectively. The velocity of the masers also allows us to determine a kinematic distance to the supernova remnants (SNRs). Our criteria for a maser to be associated with an SNR along the line of sight are that the position and velocity of the maser and SNR must agree and the OH (1720) emission must be unaccompanied by other OH lines.},

abstract = {We analyse new HI spectra of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) together with 13CO(J=1-0) spectra to obtain new distance estimates and evidence for interaction between SNRs and molecular clouds. The SNRs that we study include: the two SNRs associated with TeV sources-- G18.8+0.3 and G23.3-0.3 (W41); one young SNR associated with an Anomalous X-ray Pulsar (AXP)-- Kes 73 associated with AXP 1E1841+045; one SNR with the young pulsar/pulsar wind nebula PSR J1846-0258 at center-- Kes 75; and Kes 69. The HI data come from the observations of the VLA Galactic Plane Survey. The 13CO(J=1-0) data are from the Galactic ring survey taken by the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory 14m telescope. The HI spectra are constructed using new methods which include improved background subtraction and spurious emission rejection.The CO spectra are used to help distinguish between HI absorption features that occur either closer than or further than the tangent point, thus help to resolve the distance ambiguity. The revised distances we obtain for the six SNRs are: Kes 75-- 5.3 kpc; Kes 73-- 5.2 kpc, Kes 73-- 7.5-9.4 kpc, W41-- 3.9-4.5 kpc, G18.8+0.3-- 12 kpc. Some of these values differ greatly from previously published values, primarily because our methods resolve the near/far distance ambiguity, which may have previously incorrectly done. The distance changes can result in significant changes in interpretation of the SNR (and associated object) properties.

The radio spectrum of the central compact source (0125+628) is analyzed in the range 178 MHz - 8.7 GHz, indicating a flat spectrum with synchrotron self-absorption below 800 MHz. The SNR's flux density at 408 MHz is 17.1$\pm$1.7 Jy and at 1420 MHz is 10.0$\pm$0.8 Jy, corrected for flux densities from compact sources within the SNR. The SNR's integrated flux density based spectral index (S$_{\nu}$$\propto$$\nu$$^{-\alpha}$) is 0.43$\pm$0.10. The respective T-T plot spectral index (derived from the relative size of brightness temperature variations between two frequencies, see text for details) is 0.46$\pm$0.01. There is no evidence at 1$\sigma$ for spatial variations in spectral index within G127.1+0.5. In particular, we compared the northern shell, southern shell and central diffuse region. HI observations show structures associated with the SNR in the radial velocity range of -12 to -16 km$/$s, suggesting G127.1+0.5's distance is 1.15 kpc. The estimated Sedov age is 2 - 3 $\times$$10^{4}$ yr.},

The X-ray spectrum from an SNR carries a wealth of information about the temperature and ionization state of the plasma, the density distribution of the postshock material, and the composition of the ejecta. This, in turn, places strong constraints on the properties of the progenitor star, the explosive nucleosynthesis that produced the remnant, the properties of the environment into which the SNR expands, and the effects of particle acceleration on its dynamical evolution. Here I present results from X-ray studies SNRs in various evolutionary states, and highlight key results inferred from the thermal emission.},

abstract = {In order to better understand molecular clouds and their properties toward the Galactic center region, we have analyzed the NANTEN database of 12CO (J = 1-0) and 13CO (J = 1-0) to search for associations with candidates for young high-mass star-forming regions, such as IRAS point sources, radio continuum sources, recombination line sources, maser line sources, and other molecular line sources. We have also compared the data with TeV $\gamma$-ray sources. The analyzed region covers -12$\,^{\circ}$ ≤ l ≤ 12$\,^{\circ}$ and -1.$\,^{\circ}$5 ≤ b ≤ 1.$\,^{\circ}$5 for 12CO, and -6$\,^{\circ}$ ≤ l ≤ 8$\,^{\circ}$ and -1$\,^{\circ}$ ≤ b ≤ 1$\,^{\circ}$ for 13CO. As a result, we identified 167 IRAS point sources, 73 recombination line sources, 58 maser sources, 107 radio continuum sources, and 77 molecular line sources associated with 169 positions with the CO emission. The associations among the objects with known velocity are fairly certain (68%), while those with only positional coincidence are less reliable (32%). We present a catalog of these CO clouds in a form useful for future follow-up studies. As specific examples of usage of the catalog, we highlight three outstanding regions of active star formation: W 28, W 30, and W 31. In particular, we have discovered that the W 30 region shows a striking correlation between the extended TeV $\gamma$-ray source and the molecular gas. This is a second case of such a good correlation identified from the NANTEN dataset subsequent to W 28 (Aharonian et al. 2008, A{\&}A, 481, 401). We suggest that the pulsar PSR J1803-2137 near the molecular features may play a role in $\gamma$-ray production. The W 31 region exhibits another active star formation, while no $\gamma$-ray source is yet known.},

abstract = {We report on the discovery of two supernova remnants (SNRs) designated G152.4-2.1 and G190.9-2.2, using Canadian Galactic Plane Survey data. The aims of this paper are, first, to present evidence that favours the classification of both sources as SNRs, and, second, to describe basic parameters (integrated flux density, spectrum, and polarization) as well as properties (morphology, line-of-sight velocity, distance and physical size) to facilitate and motivate future observations. Spectral and polarization parameters are derived from multiwavelength data from existing radio surveys carried out at wavelengths between 6 and 92cm. In particular for the source G152.4-2.1 we also use new observations at 11cm done with the Effelsberg 100m telescope. The interstellar medium around the discovered sources is analyzed using 1-arcminute line data from neutral hydrogen (HI) and 45-arcsecond 12CO(J=1-0). G152.4-2.1 is a barrel shaped SNR with two opposed radio-bright polarized flanks on the North and South. The remnant, which is elongated along the Galactic plane is evolving in a more-or-less uniform medium. G190.9-2.2 is also a shell-type remnant with East and West halves elongated perpendicular to the plane, and is evolving within a low-density region bounded by dense neutral hydrogen in the North and South, and molecular (12CO) clouds in the East and West. The integrated radio continuum spectral indices are -0.65+/-0.05 and -0.66+/-0.05 for G152.4-2.1 and G190.9-2.2 respectively. Both SNRs are approximately 1 kpc distant, with G152.4-2.1 being larger (32x30 pc in diameter) than G190.9-2.2 (18x16 pc). These two remnants are the lowest surface brightness SNRs yet catalogued at 5x10^-23 W m^-2 Hz^-1 sr^-1.

In addition, in order to study to study how pre-supernova winds might affect the expected emission in this class of sources, the time-dependent gamma-ray luminosity of a remnant with a massive progenitor is worked out. Solid points and limitations of the proposed scenario are finally discussed in a critical way.},

abstract = {Cosmic rays that escape their acceleration site interact with the ambient medium and produce gamma rays as the result of inelastic proton-proton collisions. The detection of such diffuse emission may reveal the presence of an accelerator of cosmic rays, and also constrain the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient in its vicinity. Preliminary results in this direction have been obtained in the last few years from studies of the gamma-ray emission from molecular clouds located in the vicinity of supernova remnants, which are the prime candidates for cosmic ray production. Hints have been found for a significant suppression of the diffusion coefficient with respect to the average one in the Galaxy. However, most of these studies rely on the assumption of isotropic diffusion, which may not be very well justified. Here, we extend this study to the case in which cosmic rays that escape an accelerator diffuse preferentially along the magnetic field lines. As a first approximation, we further assume that particles are strongly magnetized and that their transport perpendicular to the magnetic field is mainly due to the wandering of the field lines. The resulting spatial distribution of runaway cosmic rays around the accelerator is, in this case, strongly anisotropic. An application of the model to the case of the supernova remnant W28 demonstrates how the estimates of the diffusion coefficient from gamma-ray observations strongly depend on the assumptions made on the isotropy (or anisotropy) of diffusion. For higher levels of anisotropy of the diffusion, larger values of the diffusion coefficient are found to provide a good fit to data. Thus, detailed models for the propagation of cosmic rays are needed in order to interpret in a correct way the gamma-ray observations.},

G359.1-0.5, G337.8-0.1, and G349.7+0.2 were all detected with significances above 5 sigma. The excess distribution of G359.1-0.5 shows extended gamma-ray emission, which coincides with the TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1745-303. G337.8-0.1 also shows an extended nature.

abstract = {We present a catalog of $\gamma$-ray sources at energies above 10 GeV based on data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) accumulated during the first 3 yr of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission. The first Fermi-LAT catalog of >10 GeV sources (1FHL) has 514 sources. For each source we present location, spectrum, a measure of variability, and associations with cataloged sources at other wavelengths. We found that 449 (87%) could be associated with known sources, of which 393 (76% of the 1FHL sources) are active galactic nuclei. Of the 27 sources associated with known pulsars, we find 20 (12) to have significant pulsations in the range >10 GeV (>25 GeV). In this work we also report that, at energies above 10 GeV, unresolved sources account for 27% $\pm$ 8% of the isotropic $\gamma$-ray background, while the unresolved Galactic population contributes only at the few percent level to the Galactic diffuse background. We also highlight the subset of the 1FHL sources that are best candidates for detection at energies above 50-100 GeV with current and future ground-based $\gamma$-ray observatories.},

The model is for a leptonic nebula, in which particles are subject to synchrotron, inverse Compton, self-synchrotron Compton, adiabatic, and bremsstrahlung processes. We find that 3C58 is compatible with being a particle dominated nebula, with a magnetic field of 35$\mu$G. A broken power law injection fits well the multi-frequency data, with a break energy at about 40 GeV. We find that 3C58 is not expected to appear in VERITAS or MAGIC II, unless the local IR background is a factor of \sim20 off Galactic models averages. For cases in which the CMB dominates the inverse Compton contribution, we find that 3C58 will not be visible either for the Cherenkov Telescope Array.},

abstract = {Supernova remnant Kes 17 (SNR G304.6+0.1) is one of a few but growing number of remnants detected across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this paper, we analyze recent radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations of this object, determining that efficient cosmic ray acceleration is required to explain its broadband non-thermal spectrum. These observations also suggest that Kes 17 is expanding inside a molecular cloud, though our determination of its age depends on whether thermal conduction or clump evaporation is primarily responsible for its center-filled thermal X-ray morphology. Evidence for efficient cosmic ray acceleration in Kes 17 supports recent theoretical work that the strong magnetic field, turbulence, and clumpy nature of molecular clouds enhances cosmic ray production in supernova remnants. While additional observations are needed to confirm this interpretation, further study of Kes 17 is important for understanding how cosmic rays are accelerated in supernova remnants.

abstract = {Among dozens young pulsar wind nebulae, some have been detected in TeV \gamma-rays (TeV PWNe), while others have not (non-TeV PWNe). The TeV emission detectability is not correlated either with the spin-down power or with the characteristic age of their central pulsars, and it is an open problem what determines the detectability. To study this problem, we investigate spectral evolution of five young non-TeV PWNe, 3C58, G310.6-1.6, G292.0+1.8, G11.2-0.3 and SNR B0540-69.3. We use a spectral evolution model which has been developed to be applied to young TeV PWNe in our previous works. TeV \gamma-ray flux upper limits of non-TeV PWNe give upper or lower limits on parameters, such as the age of the PWN and the fraction of the spin-down power going to the magnetic energy injection (the fraction parameter). Combined with other independent observational and theoretical studies, we can guess a plausible value of the parameters for each object. For 3C58, we prefer the parameters with an age of 2.5 kyr old and the fraction parameter of 3.0x10^{-3}, although the spectral modeling alone does not rule out a shorter age and a higher fraction parameter. The fraction parameter of 3.0x10^{-3} is also consistent for other non-TeV PWNe and then the value is regarded as common to young PWNe including TeV PWNe. Moreover, we find that the intrinsic properties of the central pulsars are similar, 10^{48-50}erg for the initial rotational energy and 10^{42-44}erg for the magnetic energy (2x10^{12} - 3x10^{13}G for the dipole magnetic field strength at their surfaces). The TeV detectability is correlated with the total injected energy and the energy density of the interstellar radiation field around PWNe. Except for G292.0+1.8, a broken power-law injection of the particles well reproduces the broadband emission from non-TeV PWNe.},

abstract = {We derive the physical properties of 580 molecular clouds based on their 12CO and 13CO line emission detected in the University of Massachusetts-Stony Brook (UMSB) and Galactic Ring surveys. We provide a range of values of the physical properties of molecular clouds, and find a power-law correlation between their radii and masses, suggesting that the fractal dimension of the interstellar medium is around 2.36. This relation, M = (228 $\pm$ 18) R 2.36 $\pm$ 0.04, allows us to derive masses for an additional 170 Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) molecular clouds not covered by the UMSB survey. We derive the Galactic surface mass density of molecular gas and examine its spatial variations throughout the Galaxy. We find that the azimuthally averaged Galactic surface density of molecular gas peaks between Galactocentric radii of 4 and 5 kpc. Although the Perseus arm is not detected in molecular gas, the Galactic surface density of molecular gas is enhanced along the positions of the Scutum-Crux and Sagittarius arms. This may indicate that molecular clouds form in spiral arms and are disrupted in the inter-arm space. Finally, we find that the CO excitation temperature of molecular clouds decreases away from the Galactic center, suggesting a possible decline in the star formation rate with Galactocentric radius. There is a marginally significant enhancement in the CO excitation temperature of molecular clouds at a Galactocentric radius of about 6 kpc, which in the longitude range of the GRS corresponds to the Sagittarius arm. This temperature increase could be associated with massive star formation in the Sagittarius spiral arm.},

In section 2 we show how users can browse the database using a dedicated web front-end (http://www.physics.umanitoba.ca/snr/SNRcat). In section 3 we give some basic statistics about the records we have collected so far, which provides a summary of our current view of Galactic SNRs. Finally, in section 4, we discuss some possible extensions of this work. We believe that this catalogue will be useful to both observers and theorists, and timely with the synergy in radio/high-energy SNR studies as well as the upcoming new high-energy missions. A feedback form provided on the website will allow users to provide comments or input, thus helping us keep the database up-to-date with the latest observations.},

The kinematic distance ambiguity is resolved by examining the presence of H I self-absorption toward the 13CO emission peak of each cloud using the Very Large Array Galactic Plane Survey. We also identify 21 cm continuum sources embedded in the GRS clouds in order to use absorption features in the H I 21 cm continuum to distinguish between near and far kinematic distances. The Galactic distribution of GRS clouds is consistent with a four-arm model of the Milky Way. The locations of the Scutum-Crux and Perseus arms traced by GRS clouds match star-count data from the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire star-count data. We conclude that molecular clouds must form in spiral arms and be short-lived (lifetimes < 107 yr) in order to explain the absence of massive, 13CO bright molecular clouds in the interarm space.},

abstract = {Molecular clouds are expected to emit non-thermal radiation due to cosmic ray interactions in the dense magnetized gas. Such emission is amplified if a cloud is located close to an accelerator of cosmic rays and if cosmic rays can leave the accelerator and diffusively reach the cloud. We consider the situation in which a molecular cloud is located in the proximity of a supernova remnant which is accelerating cosmic rays and gradually releasing them into the interstellar medium. We calculate the multiwavelength spectrum from radio to $\gamma$-rays which emerges from the cloud as the result of cosmic ray interactions. The total energy output is dominated by the $\gamma$-ray emission, which can exceed the emission from other bands by an order of magnitude or more. This suggests that some of the unidentified TeV sources detected so far, with no obvious or very weak counterpart in other wavelengths, might be associated with clouds illuminated by cosmic rays coming from a nearby source.},

abstract = {Energetic pulsars can be embedded in a nebula of relativistic leptons which is powered by the dissipation of the rotational energy of the pulsar. The object PSR J0855-4644 is an energetic and fast-spinning pulsar (Edot = 1.1x10^36 erg/s, P=65 ms) discovered near the South-East rim of the supernova remnant (SNR) RX J0852.0-4622 (aka Vela Jr) by the Parkes multibeam survey. The position of the pulsar is in spatial coincidence with an enhancement in X-rays and TeV gamma-rays, which could be due to its putative pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The purpose of this study is to search for diffuse non-thermal X-ray emission around PSR J0855-4644 to test for the presence of a PWN and to estimate the distance to the pulsar. An X-ray observation was carried out with the XMM-Newton satellite to constrain the properties of the pulsar and its nebula. The absorption column density derived in X-rays from the pulsar and from different regions of the rim of the SNR was compared with the absorption derived from the atomic (HI) and molecular (12CO) gas distribution along the corresponding lines of sight to estimate the distance of the pulsar and of the SNR. The observation has revealed the X-ray counterpart of the pulsar together with surrounding extended emission thus confirming the existence of a PWN. The comparison of column densities provided an upper limit to the distance of the pulsar PSR J0855-4644 and the SNR RX J0852.0-4622 (d<900 pc). Although both objects are at compatible distances, we rule out that the pulsar and the SNR are associated. With this revised distance, PSR J0855-4644 is the second most energetic pulsar, after the Vela pulsar, within a radius of 1 kpc and could therefore contribute to the local cosmic-ray e-/e+ spectrum.},

abstract = {RX J1713.7-3946 is a key object to check the supernova remnant paradigm of the origin of Galactic cosmic rays. While the origin of its gamma-ray emission (hadronic versus leptonic) is still debated, the hard spectrum at GeV energies reported by the Fermi collaboration is generally interpreted as a strong argument in favour of a leptonic scenario. On the contrary, we show that hadronic interactions can naturally explain the gamma-ray spectrum if gas clumps are present in the supernova remnant shell. The absence of thermal X-rays from the remnant fits well within this scenario.},

abstract = {CTB 109 (G109.1-1.0) is a Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) with a hemispherical shell morphology in X-rays and in the radio band. In this work, we report the detection of $\gamma$-ray emission coincident with CTB 109, using 37 months of data from the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We study the broadband characteristics of the remnant using a model that includes hydrodynamics, efficient cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration, nonthermal emission, and a self-consistent calculation of the X-ray thermal emission. We find that the observations can be successfully fit with two distinct parameter sets, one where the $\gamma$-ray emission is produced primarily by leptons accelerated at the SNR forward shock and the other where $\gamma$-rays produced by forward shock accelerated CR ions dominate the high-energy emission. Consideration of thermal X-ray emission introduces a novel element to the broadband fitting process, and while it does not rule out either the leptonic or the hadronic scenarios, it constrains the parameter sets required by the model to fit the observations. Moreover, the model that best fits the thermal and nonthermal emission observations is an intermediate case, where both radiation from accelerated electrons and hadrons contribute almost equally to the $\gamma$-ray flux observed.},

abstract = {Energetic gamma rays (GeV to TeV photon energy) have been detected toward several supernova remnants (SNR) that are associated with molecular clouds. If the gamma rays are produced mainly by hadronic processes rather than leptonic processes like bremsstrahlung, then the flux of energetic cosmic ray nuclei (>1 GeV) required to produce the gamma rays can be inferred at the site where the particles are accelerated in SNR shocks. It is of great interest to understand the acceleration of the cosmic rays of lower energy (<1 GeV) that accompany the energetic component. These particles of lower energy are most effective in ionizing interstellar gas, which leaves an observable imprint on the interstellar ion chemistry. A correlation of energetic gamma radiation with enhanced interstellar ionization can thus be used to support the hadronic origin of the gamma rays and to constrain the acceleration of ionizing cosmic rays in SNR. Using observational gamma ray data, the primary cosmic ray proton spectrum can be modeled for E >1 GeV, and careful extrapolation of the spectrum to lower energies offers a method to calculate the ionization rate of the molecular cloud.},

Using both position-switching and On-The-Fly mapping modes, we achieved an angular sampling of 22", better than half of the telescope's 46" angular resolution. The survey's velocity coverage is -5 to 135 km s-1 for Galactic longitudes l<=40deg and -5 to 85 km s-1 for Galactic longitudes l>40deg. At the velocity resolution of 0.21 km s-1, the typical rms sensitivity is $\sigma$(T*A)~0.13 K. The survey comprises a total of 1,993,522 spectra. We show integrated intensity images (zeroth moment maps), channel maps, position-velocity diagrams, and an average spectrum of the completed survey data set. We also discuss the telescope and instrumental parameters, the observing modes, the data reduction processes, and the emission and noise characteristics of the data set.

A prediction is that the amplitude is smaller at lower energies due to incomplete sampling of the velocity field and also smaller at larger energies due to smearing.},

Information on the local diffusion coefficient and the local cosmic-ray population can be deduced from the observed gamma-ray signals. In this work we concentrate on the capability of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTA) to provide such measurements. We investigate the expected emission from clouds hosting an accelerator, exploring the parameter space for different modes of acceleration, age of the source, cloud density profile, and cosmic ray diffusion coefficient. We present some of the most interesting cases for CTA regarding this science topic. The simulated gamma-ray fluxes depend strongly on the input parameters. In some cases, from CTA data it will be possible to constrain both the properties of the accelerator and the propagation mode of cosmic rays in the cloud.},

Archival 20 cm, 11 cm, and 8 $\mu$m data have also been used to identify the SNRs and constrain their properties. The 90 cm image is sensitive to SNRs with diameters 2.5 arcmin to 50' and down to a surface brightness limit of ~10-21 W m-2 Hz-1 sr-1. This survey has nearly tripled the number of SNRs known in this part of the Galaxy and represents an overall 15% increase in the total number of Galactic SNRs.

We analysed approximately 52 months of data obtained with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Kes 79 is thought to be interacting with adjacent molecular clouds based on the presence of strong $^{12}$CO J = 1 $\rightarrow$ 0 and HCO$^{+}$ J = 1 $\rightarrow$ 0 emission and the detection of 1720 MHz line emission towards the east of the remnant. Acceleration of cosmic rays is expected to occur at SNR shocks, and SNRs interacting with dense molecular clouds provide a good testing ground for detecting and analysing the production of $\gamma$-rays from the decay of $\pi^0$ into two $\gamma$-ray photons. This analysis investigates $\gamma$-ray emission coincident with Kes 79, which has a detection significance of $\sim 7 \sigma$. Additionally we present an investigation of the spatial and spectral characteristics of Kes 79 using multiple archival XMM-Newton observations of this remnant. We determine the global X-ray properties of Kes 79 and estimate the ambient density across the remnant. We also performed a similar analysis for Galactic SNR Kesteven 78 (Kes 78), but due to large uncertainties in the $\gamma$-ray background model, no conclusion can be made about an excess of GeV $\gamma$-ray associated with the remnant.},

abstract = {G349.7+0.2 is a young Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) located at the distance of 11.5 kpc and observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to high energy (HE) Gamma-rays. Radio and infrared observations indicate that the remnant is interacting with a molecular cloud. In this paper, the detection of very high energy (VHE) Gamma-ray emission coincident with this SNR with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) is reported. An integral flux F(E>400GeV)=(6.5 +-1.1stat +-1.3syst) x 10^{-13} ph/cm/s corresponding to 0.7% of that of the Crab Nebula and to a luminosity of 10^34 erg/s above the same energy threshold, and a steep photon index Gamma_VHE = 2.8 +-0.27stat +-0.20syst are measured. The analysis of more than 5 yr of Fermi-LAT data towards this source shows a power-law like spectrum with a best-fit photon index Gamma_HE = 2.2 +-0.04stat +0.13-0.31syst. The combined Gamma-ray spectrum of G349.7+0.2 can be described by either a broken power-law (BPL) or a power-law with exponential (or sub-exponential) cutoff (PLC). In the former case, the photon break energy is found at E_br,gamma = 55 +70-30 GeV, slightly higher than what is usually observed in the HE/VHE Gamma-ray emitting middle-aged SNRs known to be interacting with molecular clouds. In the latter case, the exponential (respectively sub-exponential) cutoff energy is measured at E_cut,gamma = 1.4 +1.6-0.55 (respectively 0.35 +0.75-0.21) TeV. A pion-decay process resulting from the interaction of the accelerated protons and nuclei with the dense surrounding medium is clearly the preferred scenario to explain the Gamma-ray emission. The BPL with a spectral steepening of 0.5-1 and the PLC provide equally good fits to the data. The product of the average gas density and the total energy content of accelerated protons and nuclei amounts to nH Wp ~ 5 x 10^51 erg/cm3.},

abstract = {The Galactic CO survey of Dame, Hartmann, {\&} Thaddeus (2001; hereafter DHT) is composed of both large-scale unbiased surveys, mainly concentrated within 10$\,^{\circ}$ of the Galactic plane, and targeted observations of clouds at higher latitudes. Analysis of all-sky IRAS and 21 cm maps suggests that the DHT survey is nearly complete for clouds larger than ˜1$\,^{\circ}$, even though roughly half of the total area at |b| < 30$\,^{\circ}$ was not observed. In October 2001 we began a new survey of all of this unobserved area that is accessible to the northern 1.2 meter telescope, approximately 6,600 deg(2) between (l) = 0$\,^{\circ}$ and 230$\,^{\circ}$, mainly in the latitude range |b| = 10$\,^{\circ}$-30$\,^{\circ}$. At least 12 hours per day is being dedicated to this large project, which is sampled every 1/4 $\,^{\circ}$ (every other beamwidth) to an rms sensitivity of 0.19 K at a velocity resolution of 0.65 km s-1. As of May 2003, we have obtained 90,000 of the 106,000 spectra required to complete the survey. While, as expected, the new observations do not substantially change the DHT map, 68 relatively small and isolated molecular clouds at intermediate latitudes have so far been discovered. The survey has also been extended to b < -30$\,^{\circ}$ in two regions, one in the vicinity of the large MBM clouds 53-55 at l ˜90$\,^{\circ}$ and the other south of the Taurus clouds at l ˜170$\,^{\circ}$. Substantial amounts of molecular gas were detected in both of these high-latitude regions.},

abstract = {New large-scale CO surveys of the first and second Galactic quadrants and the nearby molecular cloud complexes in Orion and Taurus, obtained with the CfA 1.2 m telescope, have been combined with 31 other surveys obtained over the past two decades with that instrument and a similar telescope on Cerro Tololo in Chile, to produce a new composite CO survey of the entire Milky Way. The survey consists of 488,000 spectra that Nyquist or beamwidth (1/8deg) sample the entire Galactic plane over a strip 4deg-10deg wide in latitude, and beamwidth or 1/4deg sample nearly all large local clouds at higher latitudes. Compared with the previous composite CO survey of Dame et al. (1987), the new survey has 16 times more spectra, up to 3.4 times higher angular resolution, and up to 10 times higher sensitivity per unit solid angle. Each of the component surveys was integrated individually using clipping or moment masking to produce composite spatial and longitude-velocity maps of the Galaxy that display nearly all of the statistically significant emission in each survey but little noise. The composite maps provide detailed information on individual molecular clouds, suggest relationships between clouds and regions widely separated on the sky, and clearly display the main structural features of the molecular Galaxy. In addition, since the gas, dust, and Population I objects associated with molecular clouds contribute to the Galactic emission in every major wavelength band, the precise kinematic information provided by the present survey will form the foundation for many large-scale Galactic studies. A map of molecular column density predicted from complete and unbiased far-infrared and 21 cm surveys of the Galaxy was used both to determine the completeness of the present survey and to extrapolate it to the entire sky at |b|<32deg. The close agreement of the observed and predicted maps implies that only ~2% of the total CO emission at |b|<32deg lies outside our current sampling, mainly in the regions of Chamaeleon and the Gum Nebula. Taking into account this small amount of unobserved emission, the mean molecular column density decreases from ~3×1020 cm-2 at |b|=5deg to ~0.1×1020 cm-2 at |b|=30deg this drop is ~6 times steeper than would be expected from a plane-parallel layer, but is consistent with recent measurements of the mean molecular column density at higher latitudes. The ratio of the predicted molecular column density map to the observed CO intensity map provides a calibration of the CO-to-H2 mass conversion factor X≡NH2/WCO. Out of the Galactic plane (|b|>5deg), X shows little systematic variation with latitude from a mean value of (1.8+/-0.3)×1020 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s. Given the large sky area and large quantity of CO data analyzed, we conclude that this is the most reliable measurement to date of the mean X value in the solar neighborhood.},

abstract = {Cosmic rays are particles (mostly protons) accelerated to relativistic speeds. Despite wide agreement that supernova remnants (SNRs) are the sources of galactic cosmic rays, unequivocal evidence for the acceleration of protons in these objects is still lacking. When accelerated protons encounter interstellar material, they produce neutral pions, which in turn decay into gamma rays. This offers a compelling way to detect the acceleration sites of protons. The identification of pion-decay gamma rays has been difficult because high-energy electrons also produce gamma rays via bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton scattering. We detected the characteristic pion-decay feature in the gamma-ray spectra of two SNRs, IC 443 and W44, with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. This detection provides direct evidence that cosmic-ray protons are accelerated in SNRs.},

abstract = {We present the results of an all-sky radio survey between 5 and 9 GHz of the fields surrounding all unassociated gamma-ray objects listed in the Fermi Large Area Telescope Second Source Catalog (2FGL). The goal of these observations is to find all new gamma-ray AGN associations with radio sources >10 mJy at 8 GHz. We observed with the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array the areas around unassociated sources, providing localizations of weak radio point sources found in 2FGL fields at arcmin scales. Then we followed-up a subset of those with the Very Long Baseline and the Long Baseline Arrays to confirm detections of radio emission on parsec-scales. We quantified association probabilities based on known statistics of source counts and assuming a uniform distribution of background sources. In total we found 865 radio sources at arcsec scales as candidates for association and detected 95 of 170 selected for follow-up observations at milliarcsecond resolution. Based on this we obtained firm associations for 76 previously unknown gamma-ray AGN. Comparison of these new AGN associations with the predictions from using the WISE color-color diagram shows that half of the associations are missed. We found that 129 out of 588 observed gamma-ray sources at arcmin scales not a single radio continuum source was detected above our sensitivity limit within the 3-sigma gamma-ray localization. These "empty" fields were found to be particularly concentrated at low Galactic latitudes. The nature of these Galactic gamma-ray emitters is not yet determined.},

The region contains no known large molecular cloud and most of the atomic hydrogen is within 1 kpc of the solar system. The contributions of $\gamma$-ray point sources and inverse Compton scattering are estimated and subtracted. The residual $\gamma$-ray intensity exhibits a linear correlation with the atomic gas column density in energy from 100 MeV to 10 GeV. The measured integrated $\gamma$-ray emissivity is (1.63 $\pm$ 0.05) × 10-26 photons s-1sr-1 H-atom-1 and (0.66 $\pm$ 0.02) × 10-26 photons s-1sr-1 H-atom-1 above 100 MeV and above 300 MeV, respectively, with an additional systematic error of ~10%. The differential emissivity from 100 MeV to 10 GeV agrees with calculations based on cosmic ray spectra consistent with those directly measured, at the 10% level. The results obtained indicate that cosmic ray nuclei spectra within 1 kpc from the solar system in regions studied are close to the local interstellar spectra inferred from direct measurements at the Earth within ~10%.},

abstract = {MAGIC is a system of two atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes which explores the very-high-energy sky, from some tens of GeV up to tens of TeV. Located in the Canary island of La Palma, MAGIC has the lowest energy threshold among the instruments of its kind, well suited to study the still poorly explored energy band below 100 GeV. Although the space-borne gamma-ray telescope Fermi/LAT is sensitive up to 300 GeV, gamma-ray rates drop fast with increasing energy, so $\gamma$-ray collection areas larger than 104m2, as those provided by grounds-based instruments, are crucial above a few GeV. The combination of MAGIC and Fermi/LAT observations have provided the first astrophysical spectra sampled in the inverse Compton peak region, resulting in a complete coverage from MeV up to TeV energies, as well as the discovery of a pulsed emission in the very-high-energy band. This paper focuses on the latest results on Galactic sources obtained by MAGIC which are highlighted by the detection of the pulsed gamma-ray emission from the Crab pulsar up to 400 GeV. In addition, we will present the morphological study on the W51 complex which allowed to pinpoint the location of the majority of the emission around the interaction point between the supernova remnant W51C and the star forming region W51B, but also to find a possible contribution from the associated pulsar wind nebula. Other important scientific achievements involve the Crab Nebula with an unprecedented spectrum covering three decades in energy starting from 50 GeV and a morphological study of the unidentified source HESS J1857+026 which supports the pulsar wind nebula scenario. Finally we will report on the searches of very-high-energy signals from gamma-ray binaries, mainly LS I 303+ and HESS J0632+057.},

abstract = {Recent observations of diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission (DGE) by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) have shown significant deviations, above a few GeV to about 100 GeV, from DGE models that use the GALPROP code for the propagation of cosmic ray (CR) particles outside their sources in the Galaxy and their interaction with the target distributions of the interstellar gas and radiation fields. The surplus of radiation observed is most pronounced in the inner Galaxy, where the concentration of CR sources is strongest. The present study investigates this "Fermi-LAT Galactic Plane Surplus" by estimating the $\gamma$-ray emission from the sources themselves, which is disregarded in the above DGE models. It is shown that the expected hard spectrum of CRs, still confined in their sources (source cosmic rays, SCRs), can indeed explain this surplus. The method is based on earlier studies regarding the so-called EGRET GeV excess, which by now is generally interpreted as an instrumental effect. The contribution from SCRs is also predicted to increasingly exceed the DGE models above 100 GeV, up to $\gamma$-ray energies of about 10 TeV, where the corresponding surplus exceeds the hadronic part of the DGE by about one order of magnitude. Above such energies, the emission surplus should decrease again with energy due to the finite lifetime of the assumed supernova remnant sources. Observations of the DGE in the inner Galaxy at 15 TeV with the ground-based Milagro $\gamma$-ray detector and, at TeV energies, with the ARGO-YBJ detector are interpreted to provide confirmation of a significant SCR contribution to the DGE.},

abstract = {We study the change in cosmic-ray pressure, the change in cosmic-ray density, and the level of cosmic-ray-induced heating via Alfv{\'e}n-wave damping when cosmic rays move from a hot ionized plasma to a cool cloud embedded in that plasma. The general analysis method outlined here can apply to diffuse clouds in either the ionized interstellar medium or in galactic winds. We introduce a general-purpose model of cosmic-ray diffusion building upon the hydrodynamic approximation for cosmic rays (from McKenzie {\&} V{\"o}lk and Breitschwerdt and collaborators). Our improved method self-consistently derives the cosmic-ray flux and diffusivity under the assumption that the streaming instability is the dominant mechanism for setting the cosmic-ray flux and diffusion. We find that, as expected, cosmic rays do not couple to gas within cool clouds (cosmic rays exert no forces inside of cool clouds), that the cosmic-ray density does not increase within clouds (it may decrease slightly in general, and decrease by an order of magnitude in some cases), and that cosmic-ray heating (via Alfv{\'e}n-wave damping and not collisional effects as for ~10 MeV cosmic rays) is only important under the conditions of relatively strong (10 $\mu$G) magnetic fields or high cosmic-ray pressure (~10-11 erg cm-3).},

abstract = {Pulsars are rapidly-rotating neutron stars born out of the death of stars. A diffuse nebula is formed when particles stream from these neutron stars and interact with the ambient medium. These pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are visible across the electromagnetic spectrum, producing some of the most brilliant objects ever observed. The launch of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008 has offered us an unprecedented view of the cosmic gamma-ray sky. Using data from the LAT on board Fermi, we search for new gamma-ray-emitting PWN. With these new observations, we vastly expand the number of PWN observed at these energies. We interpret the observed gamma-ray emission from these PWN in terms of a model where accelerated electrons produce gamma-rays through inverse Compton upscattering when they interact with interstellar photon fields. We conclude by studying how the observed PWN evolve with the age and spin-down power of the host pulsar.},

abstract = {The origin of Galactic cosmic rays remains unconfirmed, but promising candidates for their sources are found in star-forming regions. We report a series of X-ray observations, with Suzaku, toward the nearby star-forming region of Cygnus X. They aim at comparing diffuse X-ray emissions on and off the $\gamma$-ray cocoon of hard cosmic rays revealed by Fermi LAT. After excluding point sources and small-scale structures and subtracting the non-X-ray and cosmic X-ray backgrounds, the 2--10~keV X-ray intensity distribution is found to monotonically decrease with increasing Galactic latitude. This indicates that most of the extended emission detected by Suzaku originates from the Galactic ridge. In two observations, we derive upper limits of $3.4 \times 10^{-8}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~sr^{-1}}$ and $1.3 \times 10^{-8}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~sr^{-1}}$ to X-ray emission in the 2--10 keV range from the gamma-ray cocoon. These limits exclude the presence of cosmic-ray electrons with energies above about 50 TeV at a flux level capable of explaining the gamma-ray spectrum. They are consistent with the emission cut-off observed near a TeV in gamma rays. The properties of Galactic ridge and local diffuse X-rays are also discussed.},

We here report on the detection of a $\gamma$-ray emission source, with a significance of $24\sigma$ in 0.2--300 GeV, projectively on the northwest of SNR Kesteven 41, using 5.6 yr Fermi-LAT observation data. The $3\sigma$ error circle, 0.09 degree in radius, covers the 1720MHz OH maser and is essentially consistent with the location of the $V_{LSR}~-50 km/s $ MC with which the SNR interacts. The source emission has a power-law spectrum with a photon index $2.38\pm0.03$ and a 0.2--300 GeV luminosity $~1.6*10^{36} erg /s$ at a distance 12 kpc. There is no radio pulsar in the $3\sigma$ circle responsible for the high luminosity. While the inverse Compton scattering scenario would lead to a difficulty in the electron energy budget, the source emission can be naturally explained with the hadronic interaction between the relativistic protons accelerated by the shock of SNR~Kesteven~41 and the adjacent northwestern MC.},

abstract = {The application of Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics has flourished over the past decade, spurred by data sets of increasing size and complexity. In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarized, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

abstract = {Aims: Observations of shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs) in the GeV to multi-TeV $\gamma$-ray band, coupled with those at millimetre radio wavelengths, are motivated by the search for cosmic-ray accelerators in our Galaxy. The old-age mixed-morphology SNR W 28 (distance ~2 kpc) is a prime target due to its interaction with molecular clouds along its northeastern boundary and other clouds situated nearby. Methods: We observed the W 28 field (for ~40 h) at very high energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray energies (E > 0.1 TeV) with the HESS. Cherenkov telescopes. A reanalysis of EGRET E > 100 MeV data was also undertaken. Results from the NANTEN 4 m telescope Galactic plane survey and other CO observations were used to study molecular clouds. Results: We have discovered VHE $\gamma$-ray emission (HESS J1801-233) coincident with the northeastern boundary of W 28 and a complex of sources (HESS J1800-240A, B and C) ~0.5$\,^{\circ}$ south of W 28 in the Galactic disc. The EGRET source (GRO J1801-2320) is centred on HESS J1801-233 but may also be related to HESS J1800-240 given the large EGRET point spread function. The VHE differential photon spectra are well fit by pure power laws with indices $\Gamma$ ~2.3 to 2.7. The spectral indices of HESS J1800-240A, B, and C are consistent within statistical errors. All VHE sources are ~10' in intrinsic radius except for HESS J1800-240C, which appears pointlike. The NANTEN 12CO(J = 1-0) data reveal molecular clouds positionally associating with the VHE emission, spanning a ~15 km s-1 range in local standard of rest velocity. Conclusions: The VHE/molecular cloud association could indicate a hadronic origin for HESS J1801-233 and HESS J1800-240, and several cloud components in projection may contribute to the VHE emission. The clouds have components covering a broad velocity range encompassing the distance estimates for W 28 (~2 kpc) and extending up to ~4 kpc. Assuming hadronic origin and distances of 2 and 4 kpc for cloud components, the required cosmic-ray density enhancement factors (with respect to the solar value) are in the range ~10 to ~30. If situated at 2 kpc distance, such cosmic-ray densities may be supplied by SNRs like W 28. Additionally and/or alternatively, particle acceleration may come from several catalogued SNRs and SNR candidates, the energetic ultra compact HII region W 28A2, and the HII regions M 8 and M 20, along with their associated open clusters. Further sub-mm observations would be recommended to probe in detail the dynamics of the molecular clouds at velocites > 10 km s-1 and their possible connection to W 28.

Using the SEQUOIA array on the FCRAO 14m telescope, the GRS fully sampled the 13 CO Galactic emission (46 arcsec angular resolution on a 22 arcsec grid) and achieved a spectral resolution of 0.21 km/s. Because the GRS uses 13 CO, an optically thin tracer, rather than 12 CO, an optically thick tracer, the GRS allows a much better determination of column density and also a cleaner separation of velocity components along a line of sight. With this homogeneous, fully-sampled survey of 13 CO, emission, we have identified 829 molecular clouds and 6124 clumps throughout the inner Galaxy using the CLUMPFIND algorithm. Here we present details of the catalog and a preliminary analysis of the properties of the molecular clouds and their clumps. Moreover, we compare clouds inside and outside of the 5 kpc ring and find that clouds within the ring typically have warmer temperatures, higher column densities, larger areas, and more clumps compared to clouds located outside the ring. This is expected if these clouds are actively forming stars. This catalog provides a useful tool for the study of molecular clouds and their embedded young stellar objects.},

abstract = {Rotational transition lines of CO play a major role in molecular radio astronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the Galactic structure. Although a wealth of data exists in the Galactic plane and some well-known molecular clouds, there is no available CO high sensitivity all-sky survey to date. Such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \Planck\ HFI data because the three lowest CO rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 GHz significantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 GHz HFI channels respectively. Two different component separation methods are used to extract the CO maps from Planck HFI data. The maps obtained are then compared to one another and to existing external CO surveys. From these quality checks the best CO maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contamination are selected. Three sets of velocity-integrated CO emission maps are produced: Type 1 maps of the CO (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with low foreground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; Type 2 maps for the (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and one Type 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in order to locate the faintest molecular regions. The maps are described in detail. They are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of the Galactic Plane and also of fainter regions out of the Galactic plane. The Planck HFI velocity-integrated CO maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky CO view of the Galaxy. These maps are also of great interest to monitor potential CO contamination on CMB \Planck\ studies.},

Although blue-skies research like astronomy rarely contributes directly with tangible outcomes on a short time scale, the pursuit of this research requires cutting-edge technology and methods that can on a longer time scale, through their broader application make a difference. A wealth of examples show how the study of astronomy contributes to technology, economy and society by constantly pushing for instruments, processes and software that are beyond our current capabilities. In this essay we outline both the tangible and intangible reasons that astronomy is an important part of society. Although we have focused mainly on the technology and knowledge transfer, perhaps the most important contribution is still the fact that astronomy makes us aware of how we fit into the vast Universe.},

abstract = {We have performed an XMM-Newton imaging and spectroscopic study of supernova remnant (SNR) W28, a prototype mixed-morphology or thermal composite SNR believed to be interacting with a molecular cloud. The observed hot X-ray emitting plasma is characterized by low metal abundances, showing no evidence of ejecta. The X-rays arising from the deformed northeastern shell consist of a thermal component with a temperature of ~0.3 keV plus a hard component of either thermal (temperature ~0.6 keV) or non-thermal (photon index = 0.9-2.4) origin. The X-ray emission in the SNR interior is blobby and the corresponding spectra are best described as the emission from a cold (~0.4 keV) plasma in non-equilibrium ionization with an ionization timescale of ~4.3 × 1011 cm-3 s plus a hot (~0.8 keV) gas in collisional ionization equilibrium. Applying the two-temperature model to the smaller central regions, we find non-uniform interstellar absorption, temperature, and density distribution, which indicates that the remnant is evolving in a non-uniform environment with denser material in the east and north. The cloudlet evaporation mechanism can essentially explain the properties of the X-ray emission in the center, and thermal conduction may also play a role for length scales comparable to the remnant radius. A recombining plasma model with an electron temperature of ~0.6 keV is also feasible for describing the hot central gas with the recombination age of the gas estimated at ~2.9 × 104 yr.},

abstract = {Aims:We present new Very Large Array (VLA) radio images at 74 and 324 MHz of the SNR W44. The VLA images, obtained with unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity for such low frequencies (HPBW 37'' at 74 MHz, and 13'' at 324 MHz), have been used in combination with existing 1442 MHz radio data, Spitzer IR data, and ROSAT and Chandra X-ray data to investigate morphological and spectral continuum properties of this SNR. Methods: The observations were carried out with the VLA simultaneously at 74 and 324 MHz in the A and B configurations and at 324 MHz in the C and D configurations. The radio continuum spectral index distribution was derived through direct comparison of the combined data at 74, 324, and 1442 MHz. In addition, to isolate and identify different spectral components, tomographic spectral analysis was performed. Results: We measured total flux densities of 634 Jy and 411 Jy at 74 and 324 MHz, respectively, for W44, and from a careful assessment of published values between 22 and 10 700 MHz derived a global integrated continuum spectral index $\alpha$=-0.37 $\pm$ 0.02. The spatially resolved spectral index study revealed that the bright filaments, both around and across the SNR, have a straight spectrum between 74 and 1442 MHz, with $\alpha$˜ -0.5, with two clear exceptions: a short portion of the SNR limb to the southeast, with $\alpha$ varying between 0 and +0.4 and a bright arc to the west where the spectrum breaks around 300 MHz and becomes concave down. We conclude that at the shell and along the internal filaments, the electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission were accelerated at the shock according to a simple diffusive shock model. The positive spectrum corresponds to a location where the SN shock is running into a molecular cloud and the line of sight intersects the photo dissociation region of an HII region and a young stellar object is present. Such spectral inversion is a classic signature of thermal absorption, either from ionized gas in the postshock region, from the HII region itself, or both. The curved spectrum on the westernmost bright arc is explained as the consequence of strong post-shock densities and enhanced magnetic fields after the interaction of the SN shock with a coincident molecular cloud. No spectral index trace was found indicating any connection between the associated pulsar PSR B1953+0.1 and the surrounding shell, nor between the SNR and the 3EG 1853+0114 $\gamma$-ray source proposed to be associated with W44. The comparison of the 324 MHz image with a 4.5 $\mu$m IR image obtained with Spitzer underscored an impressive correspondence between emission both to the north and west sides of W44, while the comparison with ROSAT and Chandra images confirm that the synchrotron radio emission surrounds the thermal X-ray radiation.},

In our spatial analysis, we model the LMC cosmic-ray distribution and gamma-ray production using observed maps of the LMC interstellar medium, star formation history, interstellar radiation field, and synchrotron emission. We use bootstrapping of the data to quantify the robustness of spatial model performance. We model the LMC gamma-ray spectrum using fitting functions derived from the physics of $\pi^0$ decay, bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering. We find the integrated gamma-ray flux of the LMC from 200 MeV to 20 GeV to be $1.38 \pm 0.02 \times 10^{-7}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, of which we attribute about 10% to inverse Compton scattering and 40% to bremsstrahlung. From our work, we conclude that the spectral index of the LMC cosmic-ray proton population is 2.4$\pm$0.2, and we find that cosmic-ray energy loss through gamma-ray production is concentrated within a few hundred pc of acceleration sites. Assuming cosmic-ray energy equipartition with magnetic fields, we estimate LMC cosmic rays encounter an average magnetic field strength ~3 $\mu$G.},

With the analysis of 6 years of Fermi/LAT data we find that, what previous studies had considered a single source, consists of an extended source plus a point-like source south-east of the SNR. The extended gamma-ray emission is well correlated with the thermal X-ray emission of the SNR, and the energy spectrum displays a pronounced maximum at $\sim0.6$\,GeV. However, in a region where the radio emission is strongly and distinctly polarized, the gamma-ray spectrum shows no sign of a break. Therefore, the spatially resolved gamma-ray emission permits the study of different interaction conditions of the SNR and the surrounding medium.},

abstract = {We analyze the gamma-ray emission from 9 high latitude, translucent molecular clouds taken with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) between 250 MeV and 10 GeV. Observations of gamma-rays allow us to probe the density and spectrum of cosmic rays in the solar neighborhood. The clouds studied lie within $\sim\!$270 pc from the Sun and are selected from the Planck all-sky CO map. Gamma-rays in this energy range mostly result from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium, which is traced with three components: HI, CO, and dark gas. Every cloud is detected and shows significant, extended gamma-ray emission from molecular gas. The gamma-ray emission is dominated by the CO-emitting gas in some clouds, but by the CO-dark gas in others. The average emissivity and gamma-ray power law index from HI above 1 GeV shows no evidence of a systematic variation. The CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor shows no variation between clouds over this small spatial range, but shows significant variations within each cloud. The average CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor suggests that the CO-dark gas is molecular as opposed to optically thick HI.},

abstract = {Aims: Previous observations with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) have revealed an extended very-high-energy (VHE; E> 100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray source, HESS J1834-087, coincident with the supernova remnant (SNR) W41. The origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission was investigated in more detail with the H.E.S.S. array and the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Methods: The $\gamma$-ray data provided by 61 h of observations with H.E.S.S., and four years with the Fermi LAT were analyzed, covering over five decades in energy from 1.8 GeV up to 30 TeV. The morphology and spectrum of the TeV and GeV sources were studied and multiwavelength data were used to investigate the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission toward W41. Results: The TeV source can be modeled with a sum of two components: one point-like and one significantly extended ($\sigma$TeV = 0.17$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 0.01$\,^{\circ}$), both centered on SNR W41 and exhibiting spectra described by a power law with index $\Gamma$TeV ≃ 2.6. The GeV source detected with Fermi LAT is extended ($\sigma$GeV = 0.15$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 0.03$\,^{\circ}$) and morphologically matches the VHE emission. Its spectrum can be described by a power-law model with an index $\Gamma$GeV = 2.15 $\pm$ 0.12 and smoothly joins the spectrum of the whole TeV source. A break appears in the $\gamma$-ray spectra around 100 GeV. No pulsations were found in the GeV range. Conclusions: Two main scenarios are proposed to explain the observed emission: a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or the interaction of SNR W41 with an associated molecular cloud. X-ray observations suggest the presence of a point-like source (a pulsar candidate) near the center of the remnant and nonthermal X-ray diffuse emission that could arise from the possibly associated PWN. The PWN scenario is supported by the compatible positions of the TeV and GeV sources with the putative pulsar. However, the spectral energy distribution from radio to $\gamma$-rays is reproduced by a one-zone leptonic model only if an excess of low-energy electrons is injected following a Maxwellian distribution by a pulsar with a high spin-down power (>1037 erg s-1). This additional low-energy component is not needed if we consider that the point-like TeV source is unrelated to the extended GeV and TeV sources. The interacting SNR scenario is supported by the spatial coincidence between the $\gamma$-ray sources, the detection of OH (1720 MHz) maser lines, and the hadronic modeling.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of the new pulsar wind nebula (PWN) G141.2+5.0 in data observed with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory's Synthesis Telescope at 1420 MHz. The new PWN has a diameter of about 3.5', which translates at a distance of 4.0 kpc to a spatial extent of about 4 pc. It displays a radio spectral index of $\alpha\approx -0.7$, similar to the PWN G76.9+1.1. G141.2+5.0 is highly polarized up to 40% with an average of 15% in the 1420 MHz data. It is located in the centre of a small spherical HI bubble, which is expanding at a velocity of 6 km/s. The bubble's systemic velocity is -53 km/s and could be the result of the progenitor star's mass loss or the shell-type SNR created by the same supernova explosion in a highly advanced stage. The systemic velocity of the bubble shares the velocity of HI associated with the Cygnus spiral arm, which is seen across the 2nd and 3rd quadrants and an active star-forming arm immediately beyond the Perseus arm. A kinematical distance of 4+/-0.5 kpc is found for G141.2+5.0, similar to the optical distance of the Cygnus arm (3.8+/-1.1 kpc) and its kinematic HI distance (4.4+/-0.6 kpc). G141.2+5.0 represents the first radio PWN discovered in 17 years and the first SNR discovered in the Cygnus spiral arm, which is in stark contrast with the Perseus arm's overwhelming population of shell-type remnants.},

abstract = {The increasing sensitivity of instruments at X-ray and TeV energies have revealed a large number of nebulae associated with bright pulsars. Despite this large data set, the observed pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) do not show a uniform behavior and the main parameters driving features like luminosity, magnetization, and others are still not fully understood. To evaluate the possible existence of common evolutive trends and to link the characteristics of the nebula emission with those of the powering pulsar, we selected a sub-set of 10 TeV detections which are likely ascribed to young PWNe and model the spectral energy distribution with a time-dependent description of the nebulae's electron population. In 9 of these cases, a detailed PWNe model, using up-to-date multiwavelength information, is presented. The best-fit parameters of these nebula are discussed, together with the pulsar characteristics. We conclude that TeV PWNe are particle-dominated objects with large multiplicities, in general far from magnetic equipartition, and that relatively large photon field enhancements are required to explain the high level of Comptonized photons observed. We do not find significant correlations between the efficiencies of emission at different frequencies and the magnetization. The injection parameters do not appear to be particularly correlated with the pulsar properties either. We find that a normalized comparison of the SEDs (e.g., with the corresponding spin-down flux) at the same age significantly reduces the spectral distributions dispersion.},

Since their releases, many follow up observations of unidentified gamma-ray sources (UGSs) were performed and new procedures to associate gamma-ray sources with potential counterparts at other wavelengths were developed. Here we review and characterize all the associations as published in the 1FGL and 2FGL catalog on the basis of multifrequency archival observations. In particular we located 177 spectra for the low-energy counterparts that were not listed in the previous Fermi catalogs, and in addition we present new spectroscopic observations of 8 gamma-ray blazar candidates. Based on our investigations, we introduce a new counterpart category of "candidate associations" and propose a refined classification for the candidate low-energy counterparts of the Fermi sources. We compare the 1FGL-assigned counterparts with those listed in the 2FGL to determine which unassociated sources became associated in later releases of the Fermi catalogs. We also search for potential counterparts to all the remaining unassociated Fermi sources. Finally, we prepare a refined and merged list of all the associations of the 1FGL plus 2FGL catalogs that includes 2219 unique Fermi objects. This is the most comprehensive and systematic study of all the associations collected for the gamma-ray sources available to date. We conclude that 80% of the Fermi sources have at least one known plausible gamma-ray emitter within their positional uncertainty regions.},

abstract = {The likelihood ratio test (LRT) and the related $F$ test, do not (even asymptotically) adhere to their nominal $\chi^2$ and $F$ distributions in many statistical tests common in astrophysics, thereby casting many marginal line or source detections and non-detections into doubt. Although there are many legitimate uses of these statistics, in some important cases it can be impossible to compute the correct false positive rate. For example, it has become common practice to use the LRT or the $F$ test for detecting a line in a spectral model or a source above background despite the lack of certain required regularity conditions. In these and other settings that involve testing a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space, {\it contrary to common practice, the nominal $\chi^2$ distribution for the LRT or the $F$ distribution for the $F$ test should not be used}. In this paper, we characterize an important class of problems where the LRT and the $F$ test fail and illustrate this non-standard behavior. We briefly sketch several possible acceptable alternatives, focusing on Bayesian posterior predictive probability-values. We present this method in some detail, as it is a simple, robust, and intuitive approach. This alternative method is illustrated using the gamma-ray burst of May 8, 1997 (GRB 970508) to investigate the presence of an Fe K emission line during the initial phase of the observation.},

abstract = {Observations of the middle-aged supernova remnants IC 443, W28 and W51C indicate that the brightnesses at GeV and TeV energies are correlated with each other and with regions of molecular clump interaction, but not with the radio synchrotron brightness. We suggest that the radio emission is primarily associated with a radiative shell in the interclump medium of a molecular cloud, while the gamma-ray emission is primarily associated with the interaction of the radiative shell with molecular clumps. The shell interaction produces a high pressure region, so that the gamma-ray luminosity can be approximately reproduced even if shock acceleration of particles is not efficient, provided that energetic particles are trapped in the cooling region. In this model, the spectral shape \ga 2 GeV is determined by the spectrum of cosmic ray protons. Models in which diffusive shock acceleration determines the spectrum tend to underproduce TeV emission because of the limiting particle energy that is attained.},

abstract = {The distribution on the sky of unidentified sources at the highest energies where such a population is evident is investigated. For this purpose, sources without identification in the first Fermi-LAT catalog >10 GeV (1FHL) that are good candidates for detection above the 50-100 GeV regime are selected. The distributions of these objects around the Galactic and super-galactic plane are explored. By using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test it is examined if these sources are distributed homogeneously around these planes. Surprisingly, an indication for an inhomogeneous distribution is found for the case of the super-galactic plane where a homogeneous distribution can be excluded by a confidence level of 95%. On a 90% confidence level also a homogeneous distribution of sources around the Galactic plane can be excluded. For the hypothesis that this reflects the true distribution of sources rather than a statistical fluctuation, implications for the underlying source populations are discussed.},

One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to $\sim N^2$ for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation and API. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort.

The data slightly favors an extended emission of this supernova remnant. The spectral index of RCW 86 is found to be very hard, $\Gamma\sim1.4$, in the $0.4$ to $300$ GeV range. A one zone leptonic model can well fit the multi-wavelength data from radio to very high energy $\gamma$-rays. The very hard GeV $\gamma$-ray spectrum and the inferred low gas density seem to disfavor the hadronic origin of the $\gamma$-rays. The $\gamma$-ray behavior of RCW 86 is very similar to several other TeV shell-type supernova remnants, e.g., RX J1713.7-3946, RX J0852.0-4622, SN 1006 and HESS J1731-347.},

abstract = {Recent observations by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi satellite have revealed bright gamma-ray emission from middle-aged supernova remnants (SNRs) inside our Galaxy. These remnants, which also possess bright non-thermal radio shells, are often found to be interacting directly with surrounding gas clouds. We explore the non-thermal emission mechanism at these dynamically evolved SNRs by constructing a hydrodynamical model. Two scenarios of particle acceleration, either a re-acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) or an efficient nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (NLDSA) of particles injected from downstream, are considered. Using parameters inferred from observations, our models are contrasted with the observed spectra of SNR W44. For the re-acceleration case, we predict a significant enhancement of radio and GeV emission as the SNR undergoes a transition into the radiative phase. If sufficiently strong magnetic turbulence is present in the molecular cloud, the re-acceleration scenario can explain the observed broadband spectral properties. The NLDSA scenario also succeeds in explaining the $\gamma$-ray spectrum but fails to reproduce the radio spectral index. Efficient NLDSA also results in a significant post-shock non-thermal pressure that limits the compression during cooling and prevents the formation of a prominent dense shell. Some other interesting differences between the two models in hydrodynamical behavior and resulting spectral features are illustrated.},

In the context of the new standard Lambda-CDM cosmology we point out confusions regarding the particle horizon, the event horizon, the ``observable universe'' and the Hubble sphere (distance at which recession velocity = c). We show that we can observe galaxies that have, and always have had, recession velocities greater than the speed of light. We explain why this does not violate special relativity and we link these concepts to observational tests. Attempts to restrict recession velocities to less than the speed of light require a special relativistic interpretation of cosmological redshifts. We analyze apparent magnitudes of supernovae and observationally rule out the special relativistic Doppler interpretation of cosmological redshifts at a confidence level of 23 sigma.},

abstract = {Supernova remnants (SNRs) have emerged as one of the largest source classes in very-high-energy (VHE; E>0.1,TeV) astronomy. Many of the now known VHE gamma-ray emitting SNRs have been discovered by the H.E.S.S. imaging Cherenkov telescope array, thanks to its unique access to the inner galaxy. Statistically-significant emission of VHE gamma rays has now been detected from the direction of the supernova remnant G15.4+0.1. While the centroids of the H.E.S.S. source and the shell-type SNR are compatible, the VHE morphology suggests a center-dominated source at TeV energies, something which is at odds with the shell-like morphology observed at radio frequencies. This suggests that H.E.S.S. may be observing TeV emission from a previously unknown pulsar wind nebula (PWN) located within the boundaries of the radio shell. If this interpretation is correct, G15.4+0.1 would in fact be a composite SNR, the first case in which an SNR is identified as a composite on the basis of VHE gamma-ray observations. Archival data from MAGPIS gives exciting hints that there is radio emission from the central parts of the remnant, giving support to this hypothesis. Unfortunately, image artefacts from a nearby strong radio source produce considerable uncertainties in the radio analysis. Additional observations in both the radio and X-ray are needed to confirm the composite nature of G15.4+0.1 suggested by H.E.S.S.},

abstract = {Aims: G15.4+0.1 is a faint supernova remnant (SNR) that has recently been associated with the gamma-ray source HESS J1818-154. We investigate a hadronic scenario for the production of the gamma-ray emission. Methods: Molecular 13CO (J=1-0) taken from the Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) and neutral hydrogen (HI) data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS) have been used in combination with new 1420 MHz radio continuum observations carried out with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). Results: From the new observations and analysis of archival data we provided for the first time a reliable estimate for the distance to the SNR G15.4+0.1 and discovered molecular clouds located at the same distance. On the basis of HI absorption features, we estimate the distance to G15.4+0.1 in 4.8+/-1.0 kpc. The 13CO observations clearly show a molecular cloud about 5 arcmin in size with two bright clumps, labeled A and B, clump A positionally associated with the location of HESS J1818-154 and clump B in coincidence with the brightest northern border of the radio SNR shell. The HI absorption and the 13CO emission study indicates a possible interaction between the molecular material and the remnant. We estimate the masses and densities of the molecular gas as (1.2+/-0.5)X10^3 M_sun and (1.5+/-0.4)X10^3 cm^-3 for clump A and (3.0+/-0.7)X10^3 M_sun and (1.1+/-0.3)X10^3 cm^-3 for clump B. Calculations show that the average density of the molecular clump A is sufficient to produce the detected gamma-ray flux, thus favoring a hadronic origin for the high-energy emission.

abstract = {Composite supernova remnants (SNRs) constitute a small subclass of the remnants of massive stellar explosions where non-thermal radiation is observed from both the expanding shell-like shock front and from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) located inside of the SNR. These systems represent a unique evolutionary phase of SNRs where observations in the radio, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray regimes allow the study of the co-evolution of both these energetic phenomena. In this article, we report results from observations of the shell-type SNR G15.4+0.1 performed with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) and XMM-Newton. A compact TeV $\gamma$-ray source, HESSJ1818-154, located in the center and contained within the shell of G15.4+0.1 is detected by H.E.S.S. and featurs a spectrum best represented by a power-law model with a spectral index of $-2.3 \pm 0.3_{stat} \pm 0.2_{sys}$ and an integral flux of F$(>$0.42$\,\mathrm{TeV}$)=($0.9 \pm 0.3_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm 0.2_{\mathrm{sys}}) \times 10^{-12}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, a recent observation with XMM-Newton reveals extended X-ray emission strongly peaked in the center of G15.4+0.1. The X-ray source shows indications of an energy-dependent morphology featuring a compact core at energies above 4 keV and more extended emission that fills the entire region within the SNR at lower energies. Together, the X-ray and VHE $\gamma$-ray emission provide strong evidence of a PWN located inside the shell of G15.4+0.1, and this SNR can therefore be classified as a \emph{composite} based on these observations. The radio, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray emission from the PWN is compatible with a one-zone leptonic model that requires a low average magnetic field inside the emission region. An unambiguous counterpart to the putative pulsar, which is thought to power the PWN, has been detected neither in radio nor in X-ray observations of G15.4+0.1.

abstract = {We present a study on the possible association of unidentified gamma -ray sources in the Third EGRET (3EG) catalog with different types of galactic objects such as Wolf-Rayet and Of stars, supernova remnants (SNRs), and OB associations (considered as pulsar tracers). We have made use of numerical simulations of galactic populations of gamma -ray point sources in order to determine the statistical significance of the positional coincidences. New constraints on pure chance association are presented for SNRs and OB associations. There is overwhelming statistical support for the hypothesis that some SNRs are gamma -ray sources (we obtain probabilities of pure chance association <10(-5) ). OB star associations present higher, but still negligible probabilities (<10(-3) ). It is also shown that although massive stars present just marginally significant correlation with 3EG sources, there is a posteriori support for at least three candidates.},
